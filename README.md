A personal collection of LeetCode problem solutions implemented in Python, with detailed algorithmic explanations and complexity analysis stored in organized Jupyter Notebooks. This repository is designed to document my journey in mastering data structures and algorithms.

## Features

* **Visual Studio Code Ready:** Optimized for an integrated workflow using VS Code's native Jupyter support. Solutions are written in Python and are executable directly within the notebooks.
* **Structured Explanations:** Each solution is contained within a dedicated Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`), featuring a long-form Markdown explanation of the chosen approach, intuition, and complexity analysis.
