## 💡 Two Sum

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return *indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`*.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution**, and you may not use the *same* element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:

* **Input:** `nums = [2, 7, 11, 15]`, `target = 9`
* **Output:** `[0, 1]`
* **Explanation:** Because $\text{nums}[0] + \text{nums}[1] == 9$, we return `[0, 1]`.

## 🚀 Optimal Approach: One-Pass Hash Map

### Intuition

The goal is to find the *complement* ($\text{target} - \text{nums}[i]$) for every number $\text{nums}[i]$ in the array. Using a **Hash Map** (or Dictionary) is the key to achieving $O(n)$ time complexity. A hash map allows us to store elements we've seen and check for the complement's existence in $O(1
