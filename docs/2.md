## ⛓️ LeetCode Problem 2: Add Two Numbers

### Problem Description

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example

* **Input:** `l1 = [2, 4, 3]`, `l2 = [5, 6, 4]`
* **Interpretation:** `l1` represents the number 342, and `l2` represents the number 465.
* **Calculation:** 342 + 465 = 807
* **Output:** `[7, 0, 8]` (representing the number 807)

### Optimal Approach: Iteration with Carry

The most efficient solution is a single-pass iteration that simulates the manual process of adding numbers column by column, keeping track of any "carry."

#### **Core Idea**

1.  **Initialize:** Create a dummy head node for the result list and a pointer (`current`) to build the list. Initialize a `carry` variable to 0.
2.  **Iterate:** Loop while there are still digits in either list (`l1` or `l2`) or the `carry` is greater than 0.
3.  **Sum Digits:**
    * Get the value of the current node from `l1` (or 0 if `l1` is exhausted).
    * Get the value of the current node from `l2` (or 0 if `l2` is exhausted).
    * Calculate the `total_sum = val1 + val2 + carry`.
4.  **Update Carry and Digit:**
    * The new `carry` is the integer division of the `total_sum` by 10 (e.g., $15 / 10 = 1$).
    * The new digit is the remainder of the `total_sum` divided by 10 (e.g., $15 \pmod{10} = 5$).
5.  **Build List:** Create a new node with the calculated digit and append it to the `current` pointer in the result list. Move the `current` pointer forward.
6.  **Advance Pointers:** Move `l1` and `l2` to their next nodes (if they exist).



#### **Handling the Final Carry**

The loop must continue as long as a carry exists. If, after processing the last digits of `l1` and `l2`, the `carry` is 1 (e.g., adding $99+1$), you must create one final node to hold that carry.
