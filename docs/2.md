## ❓ Problem Description

You are given two **non-empty linked lists** representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in **reverse order**, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list (also in reverse order).

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example

**Input:** `l1 = [2,4,3]`, `l2 = [5,6,4]`
**Output:** `[7,0,8]`
**Explanation:** $342 + 465 = 807$. The output list represents $807$ in reverse.

## 💡 Solution Approach: Simulation of Grade-School Addition

The structure of the input—digits in **reverse order**—is key. It means the head of the list corresponds to the ones place, allowing us to perform long addition by traversing the lists simultaneously from head to tail.

### The Iterative Process

We use an iterative approach, maintaining a **`carry`** variable to handle overflow whenever the sum of the digits exceeds $9$.

1.  **Initialize:** A `dummy` node is created to anchor the result list, and a `current` pointer tracks the tail of the sum list. `carry` is set to $0$.
2.  **Iterate:** We loop until **both** lists are exhausted **AND** the `carry` is $0$.
3.  **Summation:** In each step, we calculate the sum of the current digits from $l1$ and $l2$ (using $0$ if a list is exhausted) plus the incoming `carry`.
4.  **Result & Carry Update:**
    * The digit for the new node is $sum \pmod{10}$.
    * The new `carry` is $sum // 10$.
5.  **List Building:** A new node is created with the result digit and appended to the result list via the `current` pointer.

## 💻 Python Implementation

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class Solution:
    """
    Adds two numbers represented by linked lists.
    """
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # Create a dummy node to simplify list construction
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        current = dummy
        carry = 0

        # Loop continues if either list has nodes OR there is a remaining carry
        while l1 is not None or l2 is not None or carry != 0:
            
            # Get the values, defaulting to 0 if the list is finished
            x = l1.val if l1 else 0
            y = l2.val if l2 else 0

            # Calculate the total sum for the current position
            sum_val = x + y + carry

            # Determine the new carry and the digit for the result node
            carry = sum_val // 10
            new_digit = sum_val % 10

            # Create and append the new node
            current.next = ListNode(new_digit)
            
            # Move the pointers forward
            current = current.next
            if l1:
                l1 = l1.next
            if l2:
                l2 = l2.next

        # The result starts immediately after the dummy node
        return dummy.next
```
