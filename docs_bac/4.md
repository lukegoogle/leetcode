## Explanation

You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, with sizes $m$ and $n$ respectively. Both arrays are already sorted in ascending order. The task is to find and return the median value of the two sorted arrays when they are combined. This problem is classified as **Hard** due to the strict time complexity requirement for the optimal solution.

The median is defined as the middle value in an ordered list of numbers. If the total number of elements, $m+n$, is **odd**, the median is the single middle element. If the total number of elements is **even**, the median is the average (mean) of the two middle elements. For instance, for `[1, 2, 3]`, the median is $2$; for `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the median is $(2+3)/2 = 2.5$.

The most crucial constraint is that your algorithm's overall run time complexity must be $O(\log(m+n))$ or better, typically achieved with $O(\log(\min(m, n)))$. This logarithmic constraint prevents a simple $O(m+n)$ solution that would merge both arrays entirely before calculating the median. Instead, the optimal solution leverages the sorted nature of the arrays and employs a **binary search** approach to efficiently find the correct partition point that isolates the elements needed to compute the median.
