    "## 🎯 LeetCode Problem 16: 3Sum Closest - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 16, \"3Sum Closest,\" is a variation of the classic 3Sum problem (LeetCode 15). The goal is to find three integers in a given array $nums$ such that their sum is as close as possible to a specified $target$ value. The challenge lies in efficiently searching through all possible triplets while maintaining and updating the minimum difference found so far, with a focus on avoiding an exponential time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Strategy: Sorting and Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient and widely accepted solution for 3Sum Closest follows the same algorithmic blueprint as 3Sum: **sorting** combined with the **Two-Pointer Technique**. The initial sorting of the array $nums$ is crucial as it takes $O(N \\log N)$ time and enables the quadratic $O(N^2)$ search that follows. Sorting allows for quick manipulation of the sum's value (by moving the pointers $L$ and $R$) and is fundamental to the algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Algorithm Initialization and Outer Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting, the algorithm initializes a variable, often called `closest_sum` or `result`, to hold the sum of the first three elements as an initial guess. This variable will be continually updated. The main part of the solution involves an outer loop, which iterates through the array with a fixed pointer $i$ from $0$ to $N-3$. For each $nums[i]$, we are essentially reducing the problem to a two-sum closest problem on the remainder of the array, targeting $target' = target - nums[i]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➡️ The Two-Pointer Search and Convergence\n",
    "\n",
    "For each fixed $nums[i]$, two inner pointers, $L$ (left) and $R$ (right), are initialized: $L = i+1$ and $R = N-1$. The inner loop runs as long as $L < R$. In each iteration, the current triplet sum $S$ is calculated: $S = nums[i] + nums[L] + nums[R]$. The core logic then compares the absolute difference between $S$ and $target$ with the absolute difference of the current `closest_sum` and $target$. If the new difference $|S - target|$ is smaller, `closest_sum` is updated to $S$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Pointer Movement for Minimum Difference\n",
    "\n",
    "The movement of the pointers $L$ and $R$ is directed by the comparison between the current sum $S$ and the $target$:\n",
    "1.  **If $S < target$:** The current sum is too small. To increase the sum and get closer to the target, the left pointer $L$ is incremented ($L++$) to include a larger number.\n",
    "2.  **If $S > target$:** The current sum is too large. To decrease the sum and get closer to the target, the right pointer $R$ is decremented ($R--$) to include a smaller number.\n",
    "3.  **If $S = target$:** If an exact match is found, the difference is zero, which is the smallest possible. The search terminates immediately, and $target$ is returned. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Complexity and Uniqueness\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the 3Sum problem, 3Sum Closest typically does **not** require explicit duplication checks. Since we are looking for *any* triplet whose sum is closest to the target (not necessarily unique triplets), the simple movement of the pointers is sufficient. The sorting step already prevents redundant processing that could arise from different orderings of the same set of numbers. The time complexity is dominated by the nested loop structure, resulting in an efficient **$O(N^2)$** solution, where $N$ is the length of the array $nums$. The space complexity is $O(\\log N)$ or $O(N)$, depending on the sorting algorithm used."
