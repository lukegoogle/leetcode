    "## 🎯 LeetCode Problem 18: 4Sum - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 18, \"4Sum,\" is a further generalization of the 2Sum and 3Sum problems, requiring the identification of all unique quadruplets $[a, b, c, d]$ in a given integer array $nums$ such that their sum equals a specific $target$ value ($a + b + c + d = target$). This problem introduces the complexity of managing four nested loops and demands extremely careful handling of duplicate solutions to maintain efficiency and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Brute-Force and The Efficiency Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive, brute-force approach would use four nested loops to check every single combination of four indices $(i, j, k, l)$. This immediately results in an unacceptable $O(N^4)$ time complexity. With array lengths up to $200$, this approach is far too slow. To achieve an acceptable runtime, the $4$-sum problem must be optimized down to $O(N^3)$, which is the standard upper bound for $k$-Sum problems (where $k$ is fixed). The strategy to achieve this involves reducing the problem's complexity by fixing two variables and using an $O(N)$ search technique for the remaining two.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The $O(N^3)$ Optimized Strategy: Sorting and Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary algorithmic approach leverages three techniques for optimization and correctness:\n",
    "1.  **Sorting ($O(N \\log N)$):** The array $nums$ is sorted first. This is crucial for two reasons: (a) it enables the efficient Two-Pointer search, and (b) it allows for straightforward identification and skipping of duplicate elements.\n",
    "2.  **Fixing Two Elements ($O(N^2)$):** Two outer pointers, $i$ and $j$, are used to fix the first two elements of the quadruplet, $nums[i]$ and $nums[j]$, where $j > i$.\n",
    "3.  **Two Pointers for 2Sum ($O(N)$):** For each pair $(i, j)$, the subproblem is reduced to finding two numbers, $nums[L]$ and $nums[R]$, in the remaining subarray (from index $j+1$ to $N-1$) that sum up to $target' = target - (nums[i] + nums[j])$. This remaining 2Sum is solved with the highly efficient Two-Pointer Technique, using pointers $L$ (Left) and $R$ (Right).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➡️ The Two-Pointer Convergence and Sum Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner Two-Pointer loop searches for the complement sum $target'$: $L$ starts at $j+1$ and $R$ starts at $N-1$. The current sum $S = nums[L] + nums[R]$ is calculated.\n",
    "1.  **If $S < target'$:** The sum is too small. To increase the sum, $L$ is moved inward: $L++$.\n",
    "2.  **If $S > target'$:** The sum is too large. To decrease the sum, $R$ is moved inward: $R--$.\n",
    "3.  **If $S = target'$:** A valid quadruplet $[nums[i], nums[j], nums[L], nums[R]]$ has been found. This quadruplet is added to the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 Duplication Elimination: Multi-Layered Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring the uniqueness of the quadruplets is the most intricate part of the 4Sum solution, requiring checks at all levels of the nested loops. The sorting step is what makes these checks possible:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Outer Loop Duplicates (Pointer $i$):** After processing $nums[i]$, we check if $nums[i+1]$ is the same. If it is, we increment $i$ repeatedly until it points to a unique element. This ensures the first element of the quadruplet is unique across iterations.\n",
    "2.  **Second Outer Loop Duplicates (Pointer $j$):** Similarly, after processing $nums[j]$ for a fixed $i$, we check and skip $nums[j+1]$ if it's a duplicate of $nums[j]$.\n",
    "3.  **Inner Loop Duplicates (Pointers $L$ and $R$):** After a valid quadruplet is found ($S = target'$), we immediately increment $L$ past all duplicate values ($nums[L] = nums[L+1]$) and decrement $R$ past all duplicate values ($nums[R] = nums[R-1]$). This ensures the next $L$ and $R$ combination is unique for the current $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time Complexity and Final Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "The total time complexity is dominated by the three nested loops: the outer loop for $i$ ($O(N)$), the second loop for $j$ ($O(N)$), and the inner Two-Pointer search ($O(N)$). This yields an overall complexity of **$O(N^3)$**. While the initial sort is $O(N \\log N)$, the $O(N^3)$ operation dominates. The space complexity is $O(\\log N)$ or $O(N)$ for the sorting algorithm, plus $O(\\text{Number of Unique Quadruplets})$ to store the result list. An additional optimization often used is **pruning**: if at any point the current minimum possible sum with the remaining elements is greater than $target$, or the current maximum possible sum is less than $target$, the inner loops can be prematurely broken or skipped, saving computation time in large test cases.
