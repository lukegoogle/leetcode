    "## 📝 LeetCode Problem 20: Valid Parentheses - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 20, \"Valid Parentheses,\" is a foundational string validation problem that requires determining if a given string $S$, containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', is valid. This problem is the quintessential application of the **Stack Data Structure**, demonstrating its utility in processing sequential, paired, or hierarchical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Rules for Valid Parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "For the input string to be considered valid, two primary rules must be strictly followed throughout the entire string:\n",
    "1.  **Open Brackets Must Be Closed by the Same Type:** An opening bracket ('(', '{', or '[') must be closed by its matching counterpart (')', '}', or ']'). An opening parenthesis cannot be closed by a curly brace, for example.\n",
    "2.  **Open Brackets Must Be Closed in the Correct Order:** The closing operation must follow the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, which defines nested structures. The most recently opened bracket must be the next one to be closed. For example, \"([{}])\" is valid, but \"([)]\" is invalid because the parenthesis was closed before the square bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the string is empty, it is considered valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The Stack Data Structure and LIFO Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective way to enforce the LIFO ordering requirement is by using a **Stack**. The stack operates on the simple principle that items are added to the top (push) and removed from the top (pop). In the context of this problem:\n",
    "* When an **opening bracket** is encountered, it signifies the start of a nested structure and is pushed onto the stack.\n",
    "* When a **closing bracket** is encountered, it signals the end of a structure. We check if it correctly closes the most recently opened structure by comparing it with the element currently at the top of the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Step-by-Step Stack Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iterates through the input string $S$ character by character:\n",
    "1.  **Open Bracket Encountered:** If the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '['), it is immediately pushed onto the stack. This effectively saves the expectation of which closing bracket is required next.\n",
    "2.  **Closing Bracket Encountered:** If the character is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'):\n",
    "    * **Empty Stack Check:** First, the algorithm checks if the stack is empty. If it is, and we encounter a closing bracket, it means a closing bracket appeared without a corresponding opener, rendering the string invalid. Return `false`.\n",
    "    * **Mismatch Check:** If the stack is not empty, the top element is popped. This popped element (the most recently opened bracket) is compared to the current closing bracket. If they do not form a valid pair (e.g., popping '[' but finding ')'), the string is invalid. Return `false`.\n",
    "    * **Match Found:** If they form a valid pair, they cancel each other out, and the algorithm continues to the next character. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛑 Final Validation Checks\n",
    "\n",
    "After iterating through the entire string $S$, two final conditions must be checked to guarantee validity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Empty Stack:** If the stack is empty, it means that every opening bracket encountered had a corresponding and correctly ordered closing bracket. The string is valid.\n",
    "2.  **Non-Empty Stack (Remaining Openers):** If the stack is *not* empty, it means there are leftover opening brackets that were never closed. For instance, in the string \"([)\", the '[' remains on the stack. In this case, the string is invalid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns `true` if the stack is empty at the end, and `false` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "This Stack-based solution is highly efficient, achieving a time complexity of **$O(N)$**, where $N$ is the length of the string $S$. This is because the algorithm makes a single pass over the string, and each character results in at most one $O(1)$ stack operation (push or pop). The space complexity is also **$O(N)$** in the worst-case scenario. For instance, in a string like \"((((()))))\", the stack will temporarily hold up to $N/2$ opening brackets before the closing brackets start popping them off."
