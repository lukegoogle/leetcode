    "## 📏 LeetCode Problem 3: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 3, \"Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters,\" is a fundamental challenge that tests your ability to manage a sliding window and use a data structure (like a hash map or a set) for efficient lookups. It requires finding the length of the longest contiguous segment of characters (a substring) within a given string that does not contain any repeated characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🔑 The Sliding Window Technique\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient solution to this problem employs the **sliding window** pattern. A sliding window is a conceptual subset of the input data (in this case, a substring of the main string) that \"slides\" over the data. The window is defined by two pointers, typically named $L$ (left) and $R$ (right), representing the start and end of the current substring under consideration. The goal is to expand the window to the right ($R$ pointer moves) while contracting it from the left ($L$ pointer moves) only when a condition is violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛠️ Using a Set or Hash Map for Character Tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "To check quickly if a character is already present in the current window (i.e., the substring from index $L$ to $R$), we utilize a **set** or a **hash map**. A set is ideal here because we only need to store the unique characters currently inside the window. Checking for the presence of a character in a set takes, on average, $O(1)$ time, which is crucial for maintaining efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➡️ The Window Expansion and Contraction Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iterates by moving the right pointer $R$ forward one step at a time. Before adding the character at $s[R]$ to the window, the algorithm checks the set:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Expansion (No Repeat):** If $s[R]$ is *not* in the set, it means the character is unique within the current window. The character is added to the set, and the length of the current window ($R - L + 1$) is compared against the overall maximum length found so far, updating the maximum as needed.\n",
    "2.  **Contraction (Repeat Found):** If $s[R]$ *is* already in the set, it indicates a violation (a repeating character). To resolve this, we must **contract** the window by moving the left pointer $L$ forward. As $L$ moves, the character $s[L]$ is removed from the set. This contraction continues until the repeating character is removed from the set, making room for the current $s[R]$. Only then can $s[R]$ be added and the $R$ pointer proceed. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "Because both the left ($L$) and right ($R$) pointers traverse the string only once from left to right, and the set operations (insertion, deletion, lookup) are typically $O(1)$, the overall time complexity of this solution is a highly efficient **$O(N)$**, where $N$ is the length of the input string. This makes the sliding window approach vastly superior to a brute-force $O(N^3)$ or $O(N^2)$ solution that would check all possible substrings."
