    "The LeetCode problem 42, \"Trapping Rain Water,\" is a highly regarded challenge that requires calculating the total amount of rainwater that can be trapped between a series of vertical bars represented by a non-negative integer array, where each element represents the height of a bar. The problem asks for the total volume of water accumulated after a rainfall, assuming the bars are of width 1.\n",

    "### **The Fundamental Principle of Trapping Water**\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of water trapped above any single bar is determined by the height of the container walls surrounding it. Specifically, the water level at any given index $i$ is constrained by the **maximum height of the bar to its left** and the **maximum height of the bar to its right**. The water trapped above bar $i$ will fill up to the height of the *shorter* of these two bounding maximums, $\\text{min}(\\text{max\\_left}, \\text{max\\_right})$. The volume of water trapped at index $i$ is then calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Water at } i = \\text{min}(\\text{max\\_left}, \\text{max\\_right}) - \\text{height}[i]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This value must be non-negative; if $\\text{height}[i]$ is greater than or equal to the minimum bounding height, no water is trapped at that position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Two-Pass DP (Dynamic Programming) Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward solution involves calculating and storing the `max_left` and `max_right` arrays for every position using two passes, and then performing a third pass to calculate the total water.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pass 1: Calculate `max_left` Array:** We iterate through the `height` array from left to right. At each index $i$, `max_left[i]` stores the maximum height encountered so far, up to and including $i-1$. This array is populated in $O(N)$ time.\n",
    "2.  **Pass 2: Calculate `max_right` Array:** We iterate through the `height` array from right to left. At each index $i$, `max_right[i]` stores the maximum height encountered so far, from $i+1$ up to the end of the array. This array is also populated in $O(N)$ time.\n",
    "3.  **Pass 3: Calculate Total Trapped Water:** We iterate through the array once more. For each index $i$ from $1$ to $N-2$ (excluding the edges where no water can be trapped), we calculate the trapped water using the formula: $\\text{water} = \\max(0, \\text{min}(\\text{max\\_left}[i], \\text{max\\_right}[i]) - \\text{height}[i])$. We sum up these values to get the total.\n",
    "\n",
    "This DP approach is correct and easy to understand but uses $O(N)$ extra space for the two auxiliary arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Optimal Two-Pointer Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the optimal $O(1)$ space complexity, we can use the **Two-Pointer** technique. This method avoids pre-calculating the full `max_left` and `max_right` arrays by calculating the necessary maximum on the fly, only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:** We use a `left` pointer starting at index 0 and a `right` pointer starting at index $N-1$. We also maintain two variables: `max_left` and `max_right`, which track the maximum bar height encountered so far from the left and right sides, respectively. The total `trapped_water` is initialized to 0.\n",
    "2.  **The Core Invariant:** The key insight is that if $\\text{max\\_left} < \\text{max\\_right}$, the water trapped at the current `left` position is guaranteed to be $\\text{max\\_left} - \\text{height}[left]$. This is because even if there were a bar taller than $\\text{max\\_right}$ to the right, the water level is already constrained by the shorter $\\text{max\\_left}$. Therefore, we don't need to know the true global maximum to the right; we only need $\\text{max\\_right} > \\text{max\\_left}$.\n",
    "3.  **Iteration Logic:** The loop continues as long as $\\text{left} < \\text{right}$.\n",
    "    * **If $\\text{height}[left] < \\text{height}[right]$:** We focus on the left side. Update $\\text{max\\_left} = \\max(\\text{max\\_left}, \\text{height}[left])$. If $\\text{height}[left] < \\text{max\\_left}$, we calculate trapped water: $\\text{trapped\\_water} += \\text{max\\_left} - \\text{height}[left]$. Advance $\\text{left}++$.\n",
    "    * **If $\\text{height}[left] \\ge \\text{height}[right]$:** We focus on the right side. Update $\\text{max\\_right} = \\max(\\text{max\\_right}, \\text{height}[right])$. If $\\text{height}[right] < \\text{max\\_right}$, we calculate trapped water: $\\text{trapped\\_water} += \\text{max\\_right} - \\text{height}[right]$. Advance $\\text{right}--$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Both the Dynamic Programming approach and the Two-Pointer approach visit each element of the array a constant number of times. The Two-Pointer approach performs all the necessary comparisons and calculations in a single pass. Therefore, the time complexity for both methods is optimal linear time, $O(N)$.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "    * **DP Approach:** Requires two auxiliary arrays of size $N$, resulting in $O(N)$ extra space.\n",
    "    * **Two-Pointer Approach:** Uses only a fixed number of variables (`left`, `right`, `max_left`, `max_right`), resulting in an optimal constant space complexity of $O(1)$. This is the most efficient solution in terms of memory."
