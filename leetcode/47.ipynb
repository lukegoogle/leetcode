    "The LeetCode problem 47, \"Permutations II,\" is a continuation of the classic permutations problem (Problem 46), but it introduces the crucial complication that the input array `nums` **may contain duplicate numbers**. The task remains to generate all unique permutations of the numbers. The presence of duplicates makes a naive backtracking solution generate redundant results, necessitating a specific strategy to ensure that only unique arrangements are included in the final output.\n",

    "### **The Fundamental Challenge: Filtering Duplicate Permutations**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input is `[1, 1, 2]`, a standard permutations algorithm would treat the first '1' and the second '1' as distinct entities based on their indices, generating results like `[1_a, 1_b, 2]` and `[1_b, 1_a, 2]`. These are identical combinations and must be counted only once. The challenge is to modify the backtracking search to **prune** the branches that would lead to structurally identical permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Strategy: Sorting and Pruning Duplicates**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective and standard way to handle duplicates in combination and permutation problems is by combining two techniques: **sorting the input array** and then implementing a **conditional skip** within the backtracking loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting:** Sorting the array (e.g., `[1, 1, 2]` becomes sorted) brings identical numbers together, making it easy to check for duplicates in the adjacent elements.\n",
    "2.  **Skipping:** In the backtracking loop, if the current element is the same as the one immediately preceding it, we only proceed if the preceding element has already been used in the current permutation path. If the preceding element is the same **and** it has *not* been used yet, we skip the current element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Backtracking State and Visited Array**\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking function, say `generateUniquePermutations(current_permutation, visited)`, uses the following state:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`current_permutation`**: The list holding the sequence chosen so far.\n",
    "2.  **`visited`**: A boolean array of the same size as `nums`. `visited[i]` is `True` if $nums[i]$ is currently being used in the `current_permutation`. This array is necessary because duplicate numbers must be tracked by their original index.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Critical Duplicate Skip Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main loop iterates over the indices $i$ of the sorted `nums` array. Before choosing the number $nums[i]$, we apply the critical skip condition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{If } visited[i] \\text{ is True, continue (already used in this path)}$$\n",
    "$$\\text{If } i > 0 \\text{ AND } nums[i] == nums[i-1] \\text{ AND } visited[i-1] \\text{ is False, continue (skip)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Logic Breakdown:** The condition $i > 0 \\text{ AND } nums[i] == nums[i-1]$ identifies the current number as a duplicate of the previous number.\n",
    "* The sub-condition $visited[i-1] \\text{ is False}$ is the key: It means the *previous identical number* ($nums[i-1]$) was not chosen in the current iteration of the recursive level and has been backtracked. If we choose $nums[i]$ now, we would be generating a permutation identical to one that would have been generated if we had chosen $nums[i-1]$ instead. By skipping, we ensure that for a block of identical numbers (e.g., the two '1's), we only start a permutation with the first one of the block at that position. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Step (Choose, Recurse, Unchoose)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Choose:** If the element $nums[i]$ passes the skip condition, it is chosen:\n",
    "    * `current_permutation.append(nums[i])`\n",
    "    * `visited[i] = True`\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Recurse:** The function calls itself recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Unchoose (Backtrack):** Upon return, the state is reverted:\n",
    "    * `visited[i] = False`\n",
    "    * `current_permutation.pop()`\n",
    "\n",
    "This process continues until the `current_permutation` reaches the length of $N$, at which point it is saved as a complete, unique permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The number of unique permutations of an $N$-element array with $k_1$ duplicates of the first element, $k_2$ duplicates of the second, etc., is given by the multinomial coefficient $\\frac{N!}{k_1! k_2! \\dots k_m!}$. The backtracking algorithm must visit nodes proportional to this number. The sorting step adds $O(N \\log N)$. The overall time complexity is still bounded by $O(N \\cdot N!)$, as this is the worst-case scenario (when all elements are unique), and it is a necessary upper bound for the search space.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The space required is dominated by the storage of the unique permutations in the final result and the recursion stack depth $O(N)$. The auxiliary space for the `visited` array is $O(N)$."
