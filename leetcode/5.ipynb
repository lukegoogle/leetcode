    "## 🔄 LeetCode Problem 5: Longest Palindromic Substring\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 5, \"Longest Palindromic Substring,\" requires finding the longest substring within a given string $S$ that reads the same forwards and backward. A substring must be a contiguous sequence of characters. This problem is a classic example that can be solved using several different algorithmic approaches, ranging from dynamic programming to a more optimized \"expand around center\" method.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Brute-Force and Sub-Optimal Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward, but highly inefficient, **brute-force** approach would be to generate every single possible substring of $S$ (there are $O(N^2)$ such substrings for a string of length $N$), and for each substring, check in $O(N)$ time if it is a palindrome. This leads to an unacceptable overall time complexity of $O(N^3)$. A slightly better approach can use a dynamic programming table, $DP[i][j]$, to store whether the substring $S[i \\dots j]$ is a palindrome. This reduces the time complexity to $O(N^2)$ but still requires $O(N^2)$ space for the table.\n",

    "### 🌟 Optimal Approach: Expand Around Center\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient and common solution to this problem is the **\"Expand Around Center\"** method, which achieves $O(N^2)$ time complexity but uses minimal $O(1)$ extra space. The core idea relies on the fact that a palindrome is symmetric around its center. A string of length $N$ has $2N - 1$ potential centers: $N$ single-character centers (like 'b' in 'aba') and $N-1$ two-character centers (like 'bb' in 'abba').\n",

    "### 🔎 The Expansion Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iterates through all $N$ characters of the string, treating each as a potential center for an odd-length palindrome. For a center at index $i$, it initializes two pointers, $L = i$ and $R = i$. It then expands outwards, decrementing $L$ and incrementing $R$, checking at each step if $S[L] = S[R]$. This expansion continues as long as the pointers are within the string boundaries ($L \\ge 0$ and $R < N$) and the characters match. Similarly, for even-length palindromes, the centers are between characters. The algorithm iterates through $i$ and initializes the center as $L = i$ and $R = i+1$, performing the same expansion check. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 Tracking the Longest Palindrome\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process of expanding from all $2N - 1$ potential centers, the algorithm must maintain variables to track the **maximum length** palindrome found so far and its corresponding **start index**. Whenever a successful expansion is halted (due to a boundary or mismatch), the length of the *previous* valid palindrome is calculated, and if it exceeds the current maximum, the maximum length and the starting index are updated. By the time all potential centers have been checked, these tracking variables will hold the details of the longest palindromic substring, which can then be returned using string slicing based on the recorded starting index and maximum length."
