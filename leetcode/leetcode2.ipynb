    "## 🔗 LeetCode Problem 2: Add Two Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 2, \"Add Two Numbers,\" is another seminal problem, focusing on manipulating **linked lists** to perform a mathematical operation. It is an essential exercise in understanding how to traverse a linked list, handle pointers, and manage state (specifically, the carry-over from addition).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ The Problem Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem takes two non-empty **singly linked lists** as input. Each node in the list contains a single digit. Crucially, the digits are stored in **reverse order**, representing a non-negative integer. For example, the list $2 \\to 4 \\to 3$ represents the number 342. The task is to add the two numbers represented by these linked lists and return the result as a new linked list, also with its digits in reverse order. For instance, adding $(2 \\to 4 \\to 3)$ and $(5 \\to 6 \\to 4)$ should yield a new list representing $342 + 465 = 807$, which is $(7 \\to 0 \\to 8)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Core Concept: Simultaneous Traversal and Carry\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution involves traversing both input linked lists simultaneously, one node at a time, much like how you would perform manual long addition. The key to this traversal is managing the **carry** digit. For each position, we sum up the value of the current node from the first list, the value of the current node from the second list, and the carry-over from the previous position.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏗️ Building the Result List\n",
    "\n",
    "To construct the result, it's common practice to use a **dummy head node**. This simplifies the code by providing a starting point for the new list, eliminating the need for special casing the first node creation. We maintain a `current` pointer to the tail of the new list we are building. The sum of the three values (two digits and the carry) is calculated. The *new digit* for the result list is the **remainder** of this sum when divided by 10 (e.g., $15 \\pmod{10} = 5$). The *new carry* for the next iteration is the **quotient** of the sum when divided by 10 (e.g., $\\lfloor 15 / 10 \\rfloor = 1$). A new node with this remainder digit is then created and attached to the `current` pointer. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔚 Handling Termination and Final Carry\n",
    "\n",
    "The traversal continues as long as there are still nodes in at least one of the input lists, or if the `carry` value is greater than zero. This last condition is critical: if we've reached the end of both lists but still have a carry of 1 (e.g., adding $99 + 1 = 100$), a final node with the value 1 must be appended to the result list. Once the loop finishes, the result is the list starting from the `next` node of the initial dummy head. The time complexity is $O(\\max(L_1, L_2))$, where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are the lengths of the two input lists, as we only traverse each list once."
