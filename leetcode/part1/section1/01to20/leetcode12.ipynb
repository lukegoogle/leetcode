    "## 🏛️ LeetCode Problem 12: Integer to Roman - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 12, \"Integer to Roman,\" is a conversion challenge that requires translating a given integer (guaranteed to be between 1 and 3999, inclusive) into its corresponding Roman numeral representation. This problem tests the ability to handle a complex, non-linear number system and implement an efficient greedy algorithm based on a set of fixed symbol rules.\n",

    "### 🧐 Understanding Roman Numeral Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roman numeral system is largely additive (e.g., $\\text{II} = 2, \\text{LX} = 60$), but it also employs a subtractive principle for six specific numbers to avoid repeating a symbol more than three times:\n",
    "1.  **4:** $\\text{IV}$ (instead of $\\text{IIII}$)\n",
    "2.  **9:** $\\text{IX}$ (instead of $\\text{VIIII}$)\n",
    "3.  **40:** $\\text{XL}$ (instead of $\\text{XXXX}$)\n",
    "4.  **90:** $\\text{XC}$ (instead of $\\text{LXXXX}$)\n",
    "5.  **400:** $\\text{CD}$ (instead of $\\text{CCCC}$)\n",
    "6.  **900:** $\\text{CM}$ (instead of $\\text{DCCCC}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversion must proceed from the largest possible value to the smallest, and the input constraint of $1$ to $3999$ means we only need to consider symbols up to $\\text{M}$ (1000).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The Greedy Algorithm Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient and clean approach is a **Greedy Algorithm** that utilizes a predefined set of Roman numeral values and their corresponding symbols, listed in descending order. By processing the values from largest to smallest, we ensure that we always choose the largest possible symbol that can be subtracted from the remaining integer value. This directly incorporates the subtractive rules (like 900, 400, 90, 40, 9, 4) into the standard list of values (1000, 500, 100, 50, 10, 5, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete, ordered mapping includes 13 pairs:\n",
    "$1000 \\to \\text{M}$, $900 \\to \\text{CM}$, $500 \\to \\text{D}$, $400 \\to \\text{CD}$, $100 \\to \\text{C}$, $90 \\to \\text{XC}$, $50 \\to \\text{L}$, $40 \\to \\text{XL}$, $10 \\to \\text{X}$, $9 \\to \\text{IX}$, $5 \\to \\text{V}$, $4 \\to \\text{IV}$, $1 \\to \\text{I}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Step-by-Step Conversion Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm initializes an empty string builder to accumulate the Roman numeral symbols. It then iterates through the predefined array of integer values and their corresponding Roman symbols, starting with $1000$. For each value-symbol pair:\n",
    "1.  It checks how many times the current integer value can be subtracted from the input number $x$. This is typically done using a `while` loop or a count, checking if $x \\ge \\text{current\\_value}$.\n",
    "2.  As long as the condition is true, the corresponding Roman symbol is appended to the result string, and the value is subtracted from $x$.\n",
    "3.  The algorithm then moves to the next smaller value-symbol pair in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the list is sorted in descending order and includes the subtractive rules (e.g., $900$ is handled before $500$), the process naturally selects the optimal combination of symbols. For example, when converting $1994$: it first takes $1000$ ($\\text{M}$, $x=994$), then $900$ ($\\text{CM}$, $x=94$), then $90$ ($\\text{XC}$, $x=4$), and finally $4$ ($\\text{IV}$, $x=0$), resulting in $\\text{MCMXCIV}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time Complexity and Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "This greedy approach is exceptionally efficient. The total number of symbols in the predefined mapping is a small constant (13). The number of times the inner subtraction loop runs across all iterations is directly proportional to the magnitude of the input number $x$. Since $x$ is constrained to be less than $4000$, and we are essentially decomposing the number based on its digits and their corresponding weights (thousands, hundreds, tens, ones), the runtime is extremely fast. If $D$ is the number of symbols in the value list (13), the overall time complexity is technically $O(1)$, as the number of operations is bounded by a small constant regardless of the input value, given the constraint $1 \\le x \\le 3999$. This makes it the most robust and performant solution."
