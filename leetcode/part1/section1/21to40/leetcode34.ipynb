    "The LeetCode problem 34, \"Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array,\" asks us to find the starting and ending indices of a given `target` value in a sorted array of integers `nums`. The algorithm is constrained to run in $O(\\log n)$ time complexity, which, as the array is sorted, immediately indicates that a modified **Binary Search** approach is required. If the target is not found in the array, the function should return `[-1, -1]`.\n",

    "### **The Requirement for Two Binary Searches**\n",
    "\n",
    "A single standard Binary Search can efficiently locate *an* index where the target exists, but it cannot guarantee finding the *first* or *last* occurrence. Due to the $O(\\log n)$ constraint, we cannot simply use a standard Binary Search and then linearly scan outwards to find the boundaries. Instead, the most robust and performant solution involves executing **two separate, targeted Binary Searches**: one to find the leftmost boundary (the first occurrence) and another to find the rightmost boundary (the last occurrence).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategy 1: Finding the Left Boundary (First Occurrence)**\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the leftmost index, we perform a Binary Search, but we modify the search space adjustment rules. We define a function, say `findLeftBoundary(nums, target)`, that returns the lowest index $i$ such that $nums[i] = target$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Standard Initialization:** Initialize `low = 0`, `high = n - 1`, and `left_index = -1`.\n",
    "2.  **Modification for Left Search:**\n",
    "    * If $nums[mid] = target$: This *might* be the leftmost occurrence, so we save `left_index = mid`. Crucially, we then continue the search in the **left half** by setting $high = mid - 1$. This forces the search to look for an even earlier occurrence of the target.\n",
    "    * If $nums[mid] < target$: The target must be in the right half. Set $low = mid + 1$.\n",
    "    * If $nums[mid] > target$: The target must be in the left half. Set $high = mid - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the loop terminates, `left_index` will hold the index of the first occurrence, or $-1$ if none was found. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Strategy 2: Finding the Right Boundary (Last Occurrence)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we define a function, `findRightBoundary(nums, target)`, to find the rightmost index. This search is nearly identical to the left search, but the search space adjustment is mirrored to bias towards the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Standard Initialization:** Initialize `low = 0$, `high = n - 1$, and `right_index = -1$.\n",
    "2.  **Modification for Right Search:**\n",
    "    * If $nums[mid] = target$: This *might* be the rightmost occurrence, so we save `right_index = mid$. We then continue the search in the **right half** by setting $low = mid + 1$. This forces the search to look for a later occurrence of the target.\n",
    "    * If $nums[mid] < target$: The target must be in the right half. Set $low = mid + 1$.\n",
    "    * If $nums[mid] > target$: The target must be in the left half. Set $high = mid - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When this loop terminates, `right_index` will hold the index of the last occurrence, or $-1$ if none was found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Combining the Results**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result is an array containing the values returned by the two separate searches: `[left_index, right_index]`. It's important to note that if the `findLeftBoundary` function returns $-1$, there's no need to execute the `findRightBoundary` search, as the target is guaranteed not to exist. The initial check for the existence of the target can also be performed, but the two modified searches handle the not-found case implicitly by returning $-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Since we perform two completely independent Binary Searches, and each Binary Search takes $O(\\log n)$ time, the total time complexity remains $O(\\log n) + O(\\log n)$, which simplifies to $O(\\log n)$. This satisfies the problem's requirement for efficiency.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The solution uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers (`low`, `high`, `mid`) and the result array, resulting in $O(1)$ space complexity."
