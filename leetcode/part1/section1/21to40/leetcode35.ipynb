    "The LeetCode problem 35, \"Search Insert Position,\" is a fundamental binary search problem. It asks us to find the index of a given `target` value in a sorted array `nums`. If the target is found, we return its index. If the target is **not** found, we must return the index where it would be inserted while maintaining the array's sorted order. This problem is explicitly designed to be solved using a modification of the standard **Binary Search** algorithm to achieve $O(\\log n)$ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Requirement and Binary Search Rationale**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input array `nums` is guaranteed to be sorted, and the required time complexity is logarithmic, Binary Search is the only acceptable solution. The modification to the standard Binary Search is that the algorithm must not only locate an existing element but must also correctly deduce the insertion point for a non-existent element. The returned index will always be the first index $i$ such that $nums[i] \\ge target$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Standard Binary Search Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We initialize the search space using two pointers:\n",
    "* `low`: Set to the first index, 0.\n",
    "* `high`: Set to the last index, $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The search proceeds iteratively as long as $low \\le high$. In each iteration, the midpoint `mid` is calculated, typically as $mid = low + (high - low) / 2$ to prevent potential integer overflow issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Modified Comparison Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "The search logic requires three distinct comparison branches to both find the element and correctly narrow down the insertion range:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Match Found:** If $nums[mid] == target$, the element is found. We immediately return `mid`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Target is Smaller:** If $nums[mid] > target$, it means the target must be in the left half of the current search space (from $low$ to $mid-1$) or it must be inserted at or before `mid`. We update the search space to the left: $high = mid - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Target is Larger:** If $nums[mid] < target$, it means the target must be in the right half of the current search space (from $mid+1$ to $high$). We update the search space to the right: $low = mid + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Termination and Insertion Point Deduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight for this problem lies in what happens when the loop terminates (when $low > high$).\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the loop finishes, the `low` and `high` pointers have crossed, meaning the search space has been narrowed down to an empty range.\n",
    "* At this point, the value of the `low` pointer is precisely the **insertion index**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following examples:\n",
    "* If `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]` and `target = 2`: The search ends when `low = 1` and `high = 0`. The index returned is `low = 1`, which is correct as 2 should be inserted before 3.\n",
    "* If `nums = [1, 3, 5, 6]` and `target = 7`: The search ends when `low = 4` and `high = 3`. The index returned is `low = 4$, which is correct as 7 should be inserted after 6 (at the end).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `low` pointer, at termination, always points to the smallest index that satisfies the condition $nums[low] \\ge target$. If the target was not found, this is the guaranteed insertion point.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Alternative Implementation: Targeting the Boundary**\n",
    "\n",
    "A slightly different, often more concise, approach is to aim the Binary Search directly at the boundary. The `low` pointer is initialized to 0, and the `high` pointer is initialized to $n$. This allows the $high$ pointer to represent the index *after* the last element, simplifying the handling of elements greater than the largest in the array. The loop continues while $low < high$. The final result is the value of `low` (or `high`). This method works by converging the `low` pointer onto the first element that is $\\ge target$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The Binary Search mechanism halves the search space in every step. This inherently results in a logarithmic time complexity, $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The algorithm only uses a few constant-size integer variables for the pointers (`low`, `high`, `mid`), requiring $O(1)$ extra space."
