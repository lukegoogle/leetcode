    "The LeetCode problem 44, \"Wildcard Matching,\" is a string matching challenge where the pattern $p$ can contain two special wildcard characters: '?' and '*'. The goal is to determine if the pattern $p$ matches the entire input string $s$. The '?' character matches any single character, while the '*' character matches any sequence of characters, including an empty sequence. This problem is similar to regular expression matching but with a simplified set of wildcards.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Challenge: The Ambiguity of the Asterisk ('*')**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary difficulty in this problem comes from the '*' wildcard. When an asterisk is encountered in the pattern, it can potentially match zero, one, or multiple characters in the input string $s$. This creates a branching decision tree at every step, making a simple linear traversal insufficient. For example, if $s = \\text{\"adceb\"}$ and $p = \\text{\"a*b\"}$, the '*' can match the empty sequence, $\\text{\"d\"}$, $\\text{\"dc\"}$, or $\\text{\"dce\"}$. The solution must explore all these possibilities efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach 1: Dynamic Programming (DP)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and structurally sound solution is Dynamic Programming. We define a 2D boolean array, $dp$, where $dp[i][j]$ is `True` if the first $i$ characters of the string $s$ match the first $j$ characters of the pattern $p$. The size of the DP table is $(N+1) \\times (M+1)$, where $N = \\text{length}(s)$ and $M = \\text{length}(p)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:** $dp[0][0]$ is `True` (empty string matches empty pattern). $dp[i][0]$ is `False` for $i > 0$ (non-empty string cannot match an empty pattern). For $p$ with leading asterisks, $dp[0][j]$ is `True` if $p[0...j-1]$ consists only of asterisks, reflecting that '*' can match an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Transition Logic (Character Match/Single Wildcard):** If $p[j-1]$ is a literal character or '?', then $dp[i][j]$ is `True` if and only if $s[i-1] == p[j-1]$ (or $p[j-1] == '?'$) **and** $dp[i-1][j-1]$ is `True`. This is the standard diagonal transition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Transition Logic (Asterisk '*'):** If $p[j-1] = '*'$, it can match three possibilities:\n",
    "    * **Empty Sequence (0 match):** The '*' matches nothing. We check if the match holds without the asterisk: $dp[i][j-1]$.\n",
    "    * **One or More Characters (1+ match):** The '*' matches the current character $s[i-1]$, and potentially more. We check if the match holds for the previous character in $s$: $dp[i-1][j]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Therefore, if $p[j-1] = '*'$, $dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] \\lor dp[i-1][j]$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The final result is $dp[N][M]$. The time and space complexity for this approach are both $O(N \\cdot M)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach 2: Greedy Backtracking with Two Pointers (The Optimal Space Solution)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The DP solution can be optimized to $O(1)$ space using a **Greedy Two-Pointer** approach with explicit backtracking for the asterisk. This approach leverages the fact that we only need two pointers for $s$ and $p$ and two pointers to save the last successful asterisk match position for backtracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pointers and Anchors:** We use $i$ and $j$ to iterate through $s$ and $p$. We also use two special variables:\n",
    "    * `star_index`: Stores the index in $p$ where the last '*' was encountered.\n",
    "    * `s_save_index`: Stores the index in $s$ that corresponds to the first character the last '*' *didn't* match. This is the position to which we backtrack.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Iteration Logic:** The main loop continues while $i < N$.\n",
    "    * **Exact Match or '?':** If $s[i] = p[j]$ or $p[j] = '?'$, advance both $i$ and $j$.\n",
    "    * **Asterisk '*':** If $p[j] = '*'$, save the asterisk's position: set `star_index = j` and `s_save_index = i`. Then, advance $j$. (This is the greedy choice: assume '*' matches the empty string for now).\n",
    "    * **Mismatch and Backtrack:** If a mismatch occurs and there was a previously saved `star_index` (an asterisk is available for use):\n",
    "        * **Backtrack:** Set $j = star\\_index + 1$ (use the asterisk to match the current $s[i]$ and resume $p$ after it).\n",
    "        * **Advance $s$:** Set $i = s\\_save\\_index + 1$ (make the asterisk match one more character in $s$).\n",
    "        * **Update Save Point:** Update `s_save_index` to the new starting point for the asterisk: $s\\_save\\_index = i$.\n",
    "    * **Mismatch and No Backtrack:** If a mismatch occurs and there is no available asterisk (`star\\_index = -1`), the match fails. Return `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Final Pattern Check:** After the main loop finishes (when $s$ is fully consumed, $i=N$), we must check if the remaining characters in $p$ are all asterisks. If $p$ has trailing characters that are not '*', the match fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The greedy approach appears complex, but since both $i$ and $j$ advance almost linearly, and backtracking only occurs when an asterisk is involved, the total number of character comparisons is still bounded by $O(N \\cdot M)$ in the worst case (though often much faster in practice).\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The greedy approach only uses a fixed number of pointers and indices, achieving an optimal $O(1)$ auxiliary space complexity."
