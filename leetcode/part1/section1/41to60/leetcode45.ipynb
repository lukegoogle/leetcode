    "The LeetCode problem 45, \"Jump Game II,\" is a classic optimization challenge that requires finding the **minimum number of jumps** required to reach the last index of a given array of non-negative integers. Each element $nums[i]$ in the array represents the maximum length you can jump from that position. The problem statement guarantees that the last index can always be reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Goal and The Minimum Jumps Constraint**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal is to minimize the total count of jumps. Since we are looking for a shortest path in terms of jump count, this suggests a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** like approach, or a specialized greedy algorithm that mirrors the level-by-level exploration of BFS. A simple greedy choice at each step (always jumping the maximum possible distance) often fails because it might land you in a position with poor subsequent jump reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Greedy Approach Based on Farthest Reach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient and widely accepted solution is a highly optimized **Greedy Algorithm** that determines the best jump to take *without* needing to explicitly manage a queue, thus achieving $O(N)$ time complexity. This approach focuses on maximizing the **farthest reachable point** in the next jump.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through the array and track three key variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`jumps`**: The total count of jumps made so far.\n",
    "2.  **`current_end`**: The end of the range covered by the *last* jump. When we cross this boundary, it signifies the need for a new jump, and we increment `jumps`.\n",
    "3.  **`farthest_reach`**: The maximum index reachable from any point within the current jump's range (the range from the previous `current_end` up to the new `current_end`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Iteration and Decision Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through the array from index $i=0$ up to $N-2$ (we don't need to check the last index, as we stop once we reach it or the jump that reaches it).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Update `farthest_reach`:** In every step, we update `farthest_reach` by considering the current position's jump potential:\n",
    "    $$\\text{farthest\\_reach} = \\max(\\text{farthest\\_reach}, i + nums[i])$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Boundary Check (New Jump Required):** If the current index $i$ reaches the boundary of the last jump (`i == current_end`), it means we have explored all possible starting points for the previous jump and must now take the single best jump that leads to the `farthest_reach` we calculated.\n",
    "    * We increment the total number of jumps: $$\\text{jumps}++$$\n",
    "    * We update the boundary of the new jump: $$\\text{current\\_end} = \\text{farthest\\_reach}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the `current_end` is updated, the new range for the next jump starts at `i+1` and goes up to the new `current_end`. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Termination Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop only needs to run up to the second-to-last element, $N-2$. The greedy choice guarantees that when the loop reaches the index $i$ such that $i = \\text{current\\_end}$, the jump taken at that point will be the one that reaches the `farthest_reach` calculated so far. Since the problem guarantees reachability, the final `farthest_reach` will be $\\ge N-1$, and the final jump count will be correct. The total number of jumps needed is the accumulated value in the `jumps` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The algorithm uses a single loop that iterates through the array exactly once, from index 0 to $N-2$. All operations within the loop (maximum calculation, comparison, and updates) are $O(1)$. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear, $O(N)$.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The solution only uses a fixed, small number of variables (`jumps`, `current_end`, `farthest_reach`) for tracking the state. The space required does not depend on the input size $N$. Thus, the auxiliary space complexity is optimal constant space, $O(1)$."
