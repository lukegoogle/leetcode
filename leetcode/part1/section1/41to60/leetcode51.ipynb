    "The LeetCode problem 51, \"N-Queens,\" is a classic problem in computer science, specifically in the realm of combinatorial search and constraint satisfaction. The goal is to find all distinct ways to place $N$ non-attacking queens on an $N \\times N$ chessboard. A queen can attack any piece located in the same row, column, or diagonal. The final output should be a list of all distinct board configurations, where each configuration is represented as a list of strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Approach: Backtracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the nature of the problem—where placing one queen heavily constrains the placement of subsequent queens, and we need to find *all* possible solutions—the optimal algorithm is **Backtracking**, implemented via Depth-First Search (DFS). Backtracking allows us to systematically explore the entire search space of possible queen placements, pruning branches that lead to an invalid configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Structure and State**\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking function, often named `solve(row)`, attempts to place a queen in the current `row`. The recursion proceeds row by row, from $r=0$ to $r=N-1$. The state of the recursion is defined by the positions of the queens already placed in the previous rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:** If the `row` index reaches $N$, it means we have successfully placed $N$ queens without any attacks. A valid solution has been found. The current board configuration is converted into the required string format (with 'Q' for a queen and '.' for an empty cell) and added to the final result list. The function then returns.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Step:** For the current `row`, the function iterates through every possible column $c$ from $0$ to $N-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Constraint Checks for Validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before placing a queen at $(r, c)$, we must verify that it is not under attack by any of the queens already placed in rows $0$ to $r-1$. Checking for attacks involves three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Column Check:** No other queen can be in column $c$.\n",
    "2.  **Main Diagonal Check:** No other queen can be on the main diagonal passing through $(r, c)$. All cells on a main diagonal share the same value for $row - column$.\n",
    "3.  **Anti-Diagonal Check:** No other queen can be on the anti-diagonal passing through $(r, c)$. All cells on an anti-diagonal share the same value for $row + column$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Optimization using Sets for $O(1)$ Lookup**\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive check would iterate over all previously placed queens for every potential new placement, leading to an inefficient check. To achieve $O(1)$ time complexity for the constraint checks, we pre-track the occupied columns and diagonals using **Hash Sets** or boolean arrays initialized before the recursion begins:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `cols`: Stores all column indices $c$ that are currently occupied.\n",
    "2.  `diag1` (Main Diagonal): Stores all values of $r - c$ that are currently occupied.\n",
    "3.  `diag2` (Anti-Diagonal): Stores all values of $r + c$ that are currently occupied.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before placing a queen at $(r, c)$, we check if $c$, $r-c$, or $r+c$ are already present in their respective sets. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Backtracking Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Choose:** If the position $(r, c)$ is valid (i.e., $c$, $r-c$, and $r+c$ are not in the sets), the queen is tentatively placed:\n",
    "    * The placement is recorded on the internal board state (e.g., a simple array storing the column index for the queen in row $r$).\n",
    "    * $c$, $r-c$, and $r+c$ are added to their respective tracking sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Recurse:** The function calls itself recursively for the next row: `solve(row + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Unchoose (Backtrack):** When the recursive call returns (either a solution was found or the branch was exhausted), the state must be reverted to explore other possibilities in the current row:\n",
    "    * The queen at $(r, c)$ is removed from the internal board state.\n",
    "    * $c$, $r-c$, and $r+c$ are removed from their respective tracking sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process ensures that every possible non-attacking configuration is explored exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The problem is a variant of the Hamiltonian cycle problem, which is known to be NP-complete. While the time complexity is difficult to express precisely using standard notation, it is bounded by $O(N!)$ in the worst-case scenario due to the nature of permutations, though the pruning significantly reduces the constant factor.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The space is determined by the storage of the final solution (which can be exponential) and the space used by the tracking sets and the recursion stack depth. Since the depth is $O(N)$ and the tracking sets have a maximum size of $O(N)$, the auxiliary space is $O(N)$."
