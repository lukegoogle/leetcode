    "## 🧩 LeetCode Problem 10: Regular Expression Matching - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 10, \"Regular Expression Matching,\" is a notoriously difficult algorithmic challenge that requires determining if a given input string $S$ matches a pattern $P$ that includes two special regular expression characters: the dot (`.`) and the asterisk (`*`). This problem is a textbook example where the complex recursive structure of the matching logic is best solved using **dynamic programming** (DP) to avoid exponential time complexity due to overlapping subproblems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Understanding the Pattern Language\n",
    "\n",
    "The pattern $P$ uses two special wildcards:\n",
    "1.  **Dot (`.`):** This matches any single character.\n",
    "2.  **Asterisk (`*`):** This matches zero or more occurrences of the preceding element. The preceding element can be a literal character (like 'a' in `a*`) or the dot (`.` in `.*`). The difficulty arises because the `*` symbol introduces multiple possible match lengths (zero, one, or many).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is a **full match**, meaning the entire string $S$ must be covered by the pattern $P$, not just a substring.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Dynamic Programming Setup: Defining the State\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this efficiently, we define a 2D Boolean array, $DP[i][j]$, where $i$ is an index into the string $S$ (up to $S$'s length $m$) and $j$ is an index into the pattern $P$ (up to $P$'s length $n$). The state $DP[i][j]$ is defined as `true` if the first $i$ characters of $S$ (i.e., $S[0 \\dots i-1]$) match the first $j$ characters of $P$ (i.e., $P[0 \\dots j-1]$), and `false` otherwise. The final answer will be stored in $DP[m][n]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The table is initialized with the base case: $DP[0][0] = \\text{true}$, meaning an empty string matches an empty pattern. Other cells in the first row, $DP[0][j]$, are handled specially for the `*` wildcard, as `a*`, `a*b*`, or `.*` can match an empty string. $DP[0][j]$ is `true` if $P[j-1]$ is `*` and $DP[0][j-2]$ is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📜 Transition Rules: Non-Asterisk Case\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest transition occurs when the character $P[j-1]$ is a literal character or a dot (`.`). In this case, for $DP[i][j]$ to be `true`, two conditions must be met:\n",
    "1.  The subproblem $DP[i-1][j-1]$ must be `true` (the preceding parts of both $S$ and $P$ matched).\n",
    "2.  The current characters must match: $S[i-1]$ must equal $P[j-1]$ OR $P[j-1]$ must be the dot (`.`).\n",
    "Mathematically: $DP[i][j] = DP[i-1][j-1] \\text{ AND } (S[i-1] == P[j-1] \\text{ OR } P[j-1] == '.') $\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⭐️ Transition Rules: Asterisk Case (The Complexity)\n",
    "\n",
    "When $P[j-1]$ is an asterisk (`*`), we must consider two distinct possibilities that the `*` represents, where $P[j-2]$ is the element the asterisk applies to (let's call it $E$):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Zero Occurrences:** The $E*$ sequence matches zero elements in $S$. In this scenario, we effectively skip $E*$ in the pattern and check if $S[0 \\dots i-1]$ matches $P[0 \\dots j-3]$. Mathematically: $DP[i][j] = DP[i][j-2]$.\n",
    "2.  **One or More Occurrences:** The $E*$ sequence matches at least one element in $S$. For this to be possible, the character $S[i-1]$ must match the element $E$ ($P[j-2]$). If they match, the problem is reduced to checking if the *rest* of $S$ (i.e., $S[0 \\dots i-2]$) matches the *entire* current pattern $P[0 \\dots j-1]$, because $E*$ can match one more character. Mathematically: $DP[i][j] = DP[i][j] \\text{ OR } (match(S[i-1], P[j-2]) \\text{ AND } DP[i-1][j])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final transition for the `*` case is the logical OR of these two possibilities. The `match` function simply checks if $S[i-1]$ equals $P[j-2]$ or if $P[j-2]$ is a dot.  The time complexity is $O(m \\times n)$, which is polynomial and efficient, as we fill each of the $m \\times n$ cells of the DP table exactly once."
