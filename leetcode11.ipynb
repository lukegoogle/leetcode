    "## 💧 LeetCode Problem 11: Container With Most Water - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 11, \"Container With Most Water,\" is an optimization challenge that requires finding the maximum amount of water that can be contained between two vertical lines drawn on a plane. It's a classic problem solved using the **Two-Pointer Technique**, which is essential for optimizing solutions from quadratic $O(N^2)$ to linear $O(N)$.\n",

    "### 🧐 Problem Definition and Area Calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "The input is an array of non-negative integers, $height$, where each element $height[i]$ represents the height of a vertical line at position $i$. The line extends from $(i, 0)$ to $(i, height[i])$. The goal is to choose two lines, $i$ and $j$ ($i \\ne j$), that, along with the x-axis, form a container capable of holding the maximum possible volume of water. The area of the water held by any pair of lines is determined by two factors:\n",
    "1.  **Width:** The distance between the two lines, given by $|j - i|$.\n",
    "2.  **Height:** The height of the water is limited by the shorter of the two lines, given by $\\min(height[i], height[j])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the area is thus: $\\text{Area} = \\min(height[i], height[j]) \\times |j - i|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ The Inefficient Brute-Force Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A brute-force solution would involve checking every single possible pair of lines. This requires nested loops: the outer loop iterates through $i$ from $0$ to $N-2$, and the inner loop iterates through $j$ from $i+1$ to $N-1$. In each iteration, the area is calculated using the formula above, and the maximum area found so far is updated. Since this method checks approximately $N^2/2$ pairs, the time complexity is **$O(N^2)$**. Given that $N$ can be up to $10^5$, this quadratic solution is too slow and will result in a Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The Optimal Two-Pointer Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient solution achieves a linear time complexity of **$O(N)$** by employing the **Two-Pointer Technique**. We initialize two pointers: a left pointer, $L$, at the beginning of the array ($L=0$), and a right pointer, $R$, at the end of the array ($R=N-1$). This configuration starts by considering the container with the maximum possible width.\n",
    "\n",
    "In each step of the algorithm, the current area is calculated: $\\text{CurrentArea} = \\min(height[L], height[R]) \\times (R - L)$. The maximum area is updated with this $\\text{CurrentArea}$ if it is greater than the current maximum. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➡️ The Crucial Movement Logic\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical part of the Two-Pointer technique is deciding which pointer to move (either $L$ or $R$) to search for a potentially larger area. Since the width $(R - L)$ always decreases when a pointer moves, the only way to find a larger area is by increasing the limiting height, $\\min(height[L], height[R])$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic dictates that we should move the pointer pointing to the **shorter line**:\n",
    "1.  If $height[L] < height[R]$, the height of the current container is limited by $height[L]$. Moving $R$ inward will only decrease the width *and* retain the same limited height (or possibly decrease it, if $height[R-1]$ is even shorter). Therefore, to maximize the chance of finding a taller container, we must move the left pointer: $L++$.\n",
    "2.  If $height[R] \\le height[L]$, the height is limited by $height[R]$. For the symmetrical reason, we move the right pointer: $R--$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By discarding the shorter line at each step, we ensure that we are always moving towards a configuration that has the highest probability of increasing the limiting height to compensate for the decreasing width. The process continues until the pointers meet ($L < R$), guaranteeing that every potential maximum area has been considered in $O(N)$ time."
