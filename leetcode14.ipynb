    "## 📝 LeetCode Problem 14: Longest Common Prefix - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 14, \"Longest Common Prefix,\" requires finding the longest string that is a prefix of every string within a given array of strings, $strs$. If no common prefix exists (e.g., if one string is empty or they share no common characters at the start), an empty string $\"\"$ must be returned. This is a fundamental string processing problem that tests basic character comparison and loop termination conditions.\n",

    "### 🧐 Brute-Force and Horizontal Scanning Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A straightforward approach is to use the **Horizontal Scanning** method. This involves taking the first string in the array, $strs[0]$, as the initial candidate for the longest common prefix (LCP). We then iterate through the rest of the strings in the array, one by one. For each string $strs[i]$, we compare the current LCP candidate against it. If the LCP is not a prefix of $strs[i]$, we shorten the LCP by one character from the end, repeatedly, until it *is* a prefix of $strs[i]$ or the LCP becomes empty. If the LCP becomes empty at any point, we can immediately return $\"\"$, as no further strings can have a common prefix longer than that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The Vertical Scanning Strategy (Optimized Iteration)\n",
    "\n",
    "A more intuitive and often slightly more efficient approach is the **Vertical Scanning** method. Instead of shortening the entire LCP string, we fix a character position and check that position across *all* strings simultaneously. The process is as follows:\n",
    "1.  Use the length of the first string, $strs[0]$, to determine the maximum possible length of the LCP. Iterate through the characters of $strs[0]$ using an index $i$ (representing the current character position, starting at $i=0$).\n",
    "2.  For a fixed position $i$, iterate through *all* the remaining strings in the array, from $strs[1]$ to $strs[N-1]$.\n",
    "3.  In this inner loop, check two conditions: (a) If the current string $strs[j]$ is shorter than the position $i$, or (b) if the character at $strs[j][i]$ does not match the character at $strs[0][i]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🛑 Termination and Result of Vertical Scanning\n",
    "\n",
    "If either of the two mismatch conditions (out of bounds or differing character) is met during the inner scan for position $i$, it signifies that the LCP cannot extend beyond the character at index $i-1$. In this case, the algorithm terminates the search and returns the substring of $strs[0]$ from index $0$ up to, but not including, index $i$: $strs[0][0 \\dots i-1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the algorithm completes the inner scan for all strings without finding a mismatch, it means the character $strs[0][i]$ is common to all strings, and the outer loop proceeds to the next character position $i+1$. If the outer loop completes (meaning all characters of $strs[0]$ were common prefixes), then $strs[0]$ itself is the LCP. \n",

    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time Complexity and Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficiency of both horizontal and vertical scanning is determined by the total number of character comparisons. Let $N$ be the number of strings in the array, and $M$ be the length of the shortest string (which is the maximum possible length of the LCP).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Vertical Scanning** method performs $M$ outer iterations (for each character position). In the worst-case scenario, the inner loop compares the character with $N-1$ other strings. Therefore, the total number of comparisons is bounded by $O(M \\cdot N)$. Since $M$ is the length of the LCP, which is at most the length of the shortest string, this approach is very efficient, typically outperforming the horizontal scanning approach in cases where the LCP is very long but quickly fails when comparing to a short string.\n",

    "### 🌳 Divide and Conquer Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "A less common but equally valid and often interesting approach is **Divide and Conquer**. This recursive strategy breaks the problem down:\n",
    "1.  If the input array $strs$ has one string, that string is the LCP.\n",
    "2.  Otherwise, the array is split into two halves.\n",
    "3.  The LCP is recursively found for the left half, $LCP_{\\text{left}}$.\n",
    "4.  The LCP is recursively found for the right half, $LCP_{\\text{right}}$.\n",
    "5.  Finally, a helper function finds the common prefix between $LCP_{\\text{left}}$ and $LCP_{\\text{right}}$.\n",
    "While asymptotically, the time complexity remains $O(M \\cdot N)$ (as the total number of character comparisons across all recursive calls is still bounded by this value), it offers a parallelizable and clean structural solution."
