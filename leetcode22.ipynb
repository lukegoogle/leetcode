    "The LeetCode problem 22, titled \"Generate Parentheses,\" asks us to write a function that takes an integer $n$ and returns a list of all combinations of **well-formed** parentheses of length $2n$. A well-formed parentheses string must satisfy two primary conditions: first, it must contain exactly $n$ opening parentheses ('(') and $n$ closing parentheses (')'); second, at no point while reading the string from left to right should the number of closing parentheses exceed the number of opening parentheses. \n",

    "### **Core Problem and Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is essentially a combinatorial task requiring the construction of all valid strings of length $2n$. The value of $n$ is typically small (e.g., $1 \\le n \\le 8$), which hints that an exhaustive search or a technique that explores a well-pruned search space is feasible. For example, if $n=3$, the output includes strings like `\"((()))\"`, `\"(()())\"`, and `\"()()()\"`. The key challenge is to systematically generate only the valid strings and avoid generating millions of invalid ones, which is what a naive brute-force approach would do.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Backtracking Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and efficient solution for this problem is using **Backtracking**, often implemented with a Depth-First Search (DFS) recursive function. Backtracking works by building a solution step-by-step and, as soon as it determines that the current path cannot lead to a valid final solution, it \"backtracks\" (reverts its last decision) and tries a different path. This mechanism is crucial for **pruning** the search space, ensuring we only explore promising possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **State and Recursive Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive helper function, often called `backtrack` or `dfs`, typically needs to keep track of the current state of the string being built. This state is defined by three parameters:\n",
    "1.  **`open_count`** (or `l`): The number of opening parentheses '(' used so far.\n",
    "2.  **`close_count`** (or `r`): The number of closing parentheses ')' used so far.\n",
    "3.  **`current_string`**: The partial or complete parentheses string built up to the current step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function starts with initial counts of `(0, 0)` and an empty string, and recursively explores two branches at each step: adding an open parenthesis or adding a close parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Base Case and Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "The base case, or the point at which a valid solution is found, occurs when the length of the `current_string` is $2n$, or equivalently, when **both** `open_count` and `close_count` are equal to $n$. When this condition is met, the `current_string` represents a complete, well-formed combination, and it is added to the final result list. The function then returns to explore other branches of the search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pruning/Constraint Logic (The Rules)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the backtracking solution lies in the two constraints that govern when we are allowed to add an opening or a closing parenthesis:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Adding an Opening Parenthesis ('('):** We can add an opening parenthesis if and only if the number of opening parentheses used so far is **less than** $n$. This ensures we do not exceed the total allowed number of $n$ opening brackets.\n",
    "    $open\\_count < n$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Adding a Closing Parenthesis (')'):** We can add a closing parenthesis if and only if the number of closing parentheses used so far is **less than** the number of opening parentheses used so far. This is the condition that enforces well-formedness—you must have an unmatched opening parenthesis available before you can place a closing one.\n",
    "    $close\\_count < open\\_count$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a state violates either of these conditions, the recursive path is terminated immediately (pruned), preventing the exploration of thousands of invalid strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time and Space Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity for this problem is determined by the number of valid parentheses combinations, which is the $n$-th **Catalan number**, denoted $C_n$. The complexity is $O(C_n)$, which is asymptotically $O(\\frac{4^n}{n\\sqrt{n}})$. This exponential growth is acceptable due to the small constraints on $n$. The space complexity is primarily determined by the depth of the recursion stack, which is $O(2n) = O(n)$, and the space required to store the $C_n$ resulting strings, leading to an overall space complexity of $O(n \\cdot C_n)$.\n",
