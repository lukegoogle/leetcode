    "The LeetCode problem 25, \"Reverse Nodes in k-Group,\" is a significantly more complex variation of linked list reversal compared to problems like reversing the entire list or reversing adjacent nodes. It requires reversing the nodes of a singly linked list in groups of size $k$, while any remaining nodes at the tail of the list that form a group smaller than $k$ must be left as they are. This problem necessitates careful pointer manipulation to ensure both the internal reversal of each group and the correct re-linking of the reversed groups to one another and to the rest of the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Overall Strategy: Iterative Group Reversal**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most robust approach involves an iterative process that moves through the list group by group. For each potential group, the algorithm must first check if there are at least $k$ nodes remaining. If a full $k$-group exists, the nodes in that group are reversed. If fewer than $k$ nodes remain, the process stops, and the remaining nodes are left untouched. The complexity lies in managing the connection between the preceding, reversed, and succeeding groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preparation with a Dummy Node and Pointers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to other challenging linked list problems, a **dummy head node** is essential for simplifying the process, especially for the very first group reversal, which changes the list's head. The iteration maintains several key pointers:\n",
    "1.  **`prev`**: Points to the node *before* the current $k$-group. It acts as the anchor that will connect to the *new head* of the reversed group. Initially, `prev` points to the dummy node.\n",
    "2.  **`k_group_start` (or `curr`)**: Points to the first node of the current $k$-group to be reversed. Initially, this is the list head.\n",
    "3.  **`k_group_end` (or `k_th_node`)**: Points to the $k$-th node of the current group. Finding this node is crucial for determining if a full group exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Check for a Full Group**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before any reversal takes place, we must verify the existence of a full $k$-group. Starting from the `k_group_start`, we advance a temporary pointer $k-1$ times. If this pointer reaches `null` before completing $k$ steps, it means the remaining nodes are fewer than $k$, and the iteration must stop. The `prev` node's `next` pointer (which points to the `k_group_start`) is then left as is, preserving the rest of the list. If the $k$-th node is found, it becomes the `k_group_end`, and the reversal proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The In-Place Reversal Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the solution is a standard linked list reversal mechanism, applied only to the $k$ nodes between `k_group_start` and `k_group_end`. This reversal is typically done iteratively. Within the $k$-group:\n",
    "* The `k_group_start` node (which was the head of the group) will become the *tail* of the reversed group.\n",
    "* The `k_group_end` node (which was the tail of the group) will become the *new head* of the reversed group.\n",
    "\n",
    "This reversal takes $O(k)$ time for each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Re-linking the Groups**\n",
    "\n",
    "After a group is successfully reversed, two crucial re-linking steps must occur to integrate the newly reversed segment back into the main list:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Connecting the Preceding Group:** The `prev` pointer (which points to the node *before* the group) must be updated to point to the new head of the reversed group (which is the original `k_group_end`).\n",
    "    $$\\text{prev.next} = \\text{k\\_group\\_end}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Connecting the Following Group:** The new tail of the reversed group (which is the original `k_group_start`) must be connected to the head of the *next* group (which is the node immediately following the original `k_group_end`).\n",
    "    $$\\text{k\\_group\\_start.next} = \\text{next\\_group\\_head}$$ (where $\\text{next\\_group\\_head}$ was $\\text{k\\_group\\_end.next}$ before the reversal).\n",
    "\n",
    "After the re-linking, the `prev` pointer must be updated to the new tail of the current reversed group (the original `k_group_start`) to set up for the next iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "A more concise, albeit sometimes less intuitive, approach is **Recursion**.\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:** If the remaining list is shorter than $k$, we return the head of the remaining list.\n",
    "2.  **Reversal:** We identify the $k$-th node. If found, we recursively call the function on the sublist starting from the $(k+1)$-th node (`k\\_group\\_end.next`). This recursive call will return the head of the correctly reversed remainder of the list.\n",
    "3.  **Re-linking:** The current $k$-group is reversed. The original head of the $k$-group has its `next` pointer set to the result of the recursive call (the head of the reversed remainder). The original $k$-th node (now the new head of the reversed group) is returned to the parent call. The complexity remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $N$ be the total number of nodes in the list.\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The algorithm iterates through all $N$ nodes once. For each group of size $k$, we spend $O(k)$ time checking and $O(k)$ time reversing, which sums up to $O(N)$ total time complexity.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The iterative approach uses a constant number of extra pointers, resulting in $O(1)$ space complexity. The recursive approach, while elegant, uses $O(N/k)$ space for the depth of the recursion stack, corresponding to the number of groups."
