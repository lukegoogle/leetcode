    "The LeetCode problem 27, \"Remove Element,\" is a straightforward yet critical array manipulation task, similar in nature to \"Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array\" (Problem 26), but without the guarantee of a sorted input. The objective is to remove all occurrences of a specific integer value, `val`, from an input array `nums` **in-place** and return the new length of the resulting array. The elements of the array that are *not* equal to `val` must occupy the initial slots of the array, and the order of these remaining elements is not important.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Constraint and Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "As with many array manipulation problems in technical interviews, the core constraint is performing the operation **in-place** with $O(1)$ extra memory. The elements equal to `val` are not physically removed, but rather their positions are overwritten or skipped, such that all the desired remaining elements are compacted to the front of the array. The final element count is the number of elements not equal to `val`, and the elements beyond that new length are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Two-Pointer Approach (Fast and Slow)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard and most efficient solution for this problem is the **Two-Pointer** technique, specifically using a \"Slow Pointer\" to track the write position and a \"Fast Pointer\" to iterate and read.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Slow Pointer (`i`):** This pointer starts at index 0 and tracks the next available position to write an element that is **not** equal to `val`. This pointer essentially builds the new, compacted array from the left.\n",
    "2.  **Fast Pointer (`j`):** This pointer starts at index 0 and traverses the entire array from left to right, checking the value of each element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Iteration and Write Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "The fast pointer `j` iterates through the entire `nums` array. In each iteration, we check if the element at `nums[j]` is the element we want to remove:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Element to Keep:** If `nums[j]` is **not equal** to `val`, this element should be part of the result array. We copy this element into the position pointed to by the slow pointer: `nums[i] = nums[j]`. Then, we advance the slow pointer `i` by one to prepare for the next element to keep.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Element to Remove:** If `nums[j]` **is equal** to `val`, we simply **ignore** it. We do **not** perform a copy, and crucially, we do **not** advance the slow pointer `i`. The slow pointer remains anchored, waiting for the next element to keep to be written into its current position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fast pointer `j` always advances in every step, ensuring the entire array is scanned. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling the Unsorted Constraint (Alternative: Two Pointers from Ends)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the order of the remaining elements is not important, an alternative and often faster approach when `val` is very common is to use two pointers starting from the opposite ends of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Left Pointer (`left`):** Starts at index 0. This pointer seeks an element equal to `val`.\n",
    "2.  **Right Pointer (`right`):** Starts at the last index $N-1$. This pointer seeks an element **not** equal to `val`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop continues as long as `left` is less than or equal to `right`. If `nums[left]` equals `val`, we swap it with the element at `nums[right]` and immediately decrement `right`. The element now at `nums[left]` is the swapped element, and since we haven't checked it, we do *not* increment `left`. If `nums[left]` is *not* equal to `val`, it is an element we want to keep, so we increment `left`. This method minimizes memory movements by overwriting removed elements with elements from the end, potentially saving time if there are many elements to remove.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Termination and Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard two-pointer approach (`i` and `j` starting at 0), when the fast pointer `j` reaches the end of the array, the slow pointer `i` points one past the last element that was kept. Therefore, the value of the slow pointer `i` when the loop terminates is the exact count of elements that are *not* equal to `val`. This value, `i`, is the new length of the array to be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Both the standard (same-direction) and the alternative (opposite-direction) two-pointer approaches traverse the array at most once. Every element is visited and processed, resulting in an optimal linear time complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of the array.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** As the operation is performed entirely in-place by manipulating the existing array elements and only using a few constant-size integer pointers, the space complexity is $O(1)$, satisfying the memory constraint."
