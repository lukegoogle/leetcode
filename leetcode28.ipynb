    "The LeetCode problem 28, \"Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String,\" asks us to implement the functionality analogous to many programming languages' built-in `indexOf` or `find` functions. Specifically, given two strings, a `haystack` (the main string) and a `needle` (the substring to find), we must return the index of the first occurrence of the `needle` within the `haystack`. If the `needle` is not found, we return $-1$. If the `needle` is an empty string, the problem often specifies returning $0$, although modern programming practice often favors treating it as finding the start of the string.\n",

    "### **The Naive Brute-Force Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest method is the **Brute-Force** approach. This involves iterating through the `haystack` string with a primary outer loop, starting at every possible position where the `needle` could begin. For each starting position $i$ in the `haystack`, an inner loop checks if the substring of `haystack` starting at $i$ and having the length of `needle` is an exact match for the `needle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The outer loop runs from $i=0$ up to $N-M$, where $N$ is the length of `haystack` and $M$ is the length of `needle`. The inner loop performs up to $M$ character comparisons. This leads to a worst-case time complexity of $O(N \\cdot M)$. While this is simple to implement and passes for short strings, it is inefficient for very long strings or patterns that nearly match frequently. \n",

    "### **Optimization using String Matching Algorithms**\n",
    "\n",
    "For better performance, especially when the `haystack` is very long or the `needle` is complex, specialized string matching algorithms are required. The two most prominent are the **Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm** and the **Boyer-Moore Algorithm**. These algorithms achieve a much better time complexity by preprocessing the `needle` to avoid redundant comparisons.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **The Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **KMP Algorithm** is a significant improvement over brute-force. It uses a precomputed structure called the **Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array** (or failure function). The LPS array, built in $O(M)$ time, tells the algorithm where to restart the comparison in the `needle` after a mismatch occurs, based on the longest proper prefix of the `needle` that is also a suffix of the partially matched segment.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **LPS Array Precomputation:** This phase analyzes the `needle` and calculates the LPS array. This array stores, for every index $j$ in the `needle`, the length of the longest proper prefix of `needle[0...j]` that is also a suffix of `needle[0...j]`.\n",
    "2.  **Searching Phase:** When a mismatch occurs at index $j$ in the `needle` with index $i$ in the `haystack`, the algorithm does not restart the search from $i+1$ in the `haystack`. Instead, it uses the LPS array value at $j-1$ to shift the `needle` forward, effectively utilizing the knowledge of the characters that *did* match. The pointer $i$ in the `haystack` is rarely moved backward. The searching phase takes $O(N)$ time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total time complexity for KMP is $O(N + M)$, which is linear and optimal because every character must be examined at least once. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Boyer-Moore Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Boyer-Moore Algorithm** is often the fastest practical string matching algorithm. It operates by performing comparisons from the *end* of the `needle` backwards. When a mismatch occurs, it determines the shift size based on two heuristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Bad Character Rule:** This rule looks at the mismatched character in the `haystack` and determines how far the `needle` can be shifted so that this \"bad character\" aligns with its last occurrence in the `needle`.\n",
    "2.  **Good Suffix Rule:** This rule considers the suffix of the `needle` that *did* match (the \"good suffix\") and shifts the `needle` to align this good suffix with another occurrence of itself within the `needle`, or with a prefix of the `needle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Boyer-Moore's preprocessing is complex but takes $O(N+M)$ time, and its searching phase often has a **sub-linear** time complexity in practice, approaching $O(N/M)$ in the best case, because it can skip many characters in the `haystack`. Its worst-case time complexity remains $O(N \\cdot M)$, but this is rare in practice.\n",

    "For a typical interview setting, implementing the Brute-Force solution first is acceptable, but being able to discuss or implement KMP shows a deeper understanding of efficient algorithm design."
