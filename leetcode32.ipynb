    "The LeetCode problem 32, \"Longest Valid Parentheses,\" is a challenging string problem that requires finding the length of the longest well-formed (valid) parentheses substring within a string containing only '(' and ')'. A well-formed parentheses string is one where every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket, and the brackets are properly nested. For example, in the string `\")(()))\"`, the longest valid substring is `\"()()\"`, with a length of 4.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **The Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "One robust method for solving this is using **Dynamic Programming**. DP allows us to break down the problem into smaller, overlapping subproblems. We define an array, say $dp$, where $dp[i]$ represents the length of the **longest valid parentheses substring ending at index $i$** of the input string $S$. If $S[i]$ is '(', then $dp[i]$ must be 0, because no valid parentheses substring can *end* with an opening bracket.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **DP Transition Logic (When $S[i] = ')'$)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex part is the transition when $S[i]$ is ')'. There are two scenarios where a valid substring of length $>0$ can end at $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Case 1: The two preceding characters form \"...\" + \"()\"**\n",
    "    If the character immediately before the current valid substring (i.e., $S[i-1]$) is '(', then the current valid substring is formed by appending \"()\" to the valid substring that ended at $i-2$.\n",
    "    $$dp[i] = dp[i-2] + 2$$\n",
    "    (We use $i-2$ because $i-1$ is '(', which starts the pair, and $i$ is ')', which completes it. $dp[i-2]$ provides the length of the valid string before this new pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Case 2: The preceding valid substring is closed, e.g., \"...\" + \")(\" + \")\"**\n",
    "    If the character $S[i-1]$ is ')', meaning $dp[i-1] > 0$, we look at the character that precedes the valid substring ending at $i-1$. This preceding character is at index $j = i - dp[i-1] - 1$.\n",
    "    * If $S[j]$ is '(', it means $S[i]$ closes a large outer pair that started at $S[j]$.\n",
    "    * The new length is $dp[i-1] + 2$ (the new pair).\n",
    "    * Additionally, we must check if there was a valid substring *before* the outer pair at index $j-1$. If so, we add its length:\n",
    "    $$dp[i] = dp[i-1] + 2 + dp[i - dp[i-1] - 2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, we take the maximum value found in the $dp$ array as the final answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Stack-Based Approach (Simpler Logic)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A conceptually cleaner and equally efficient method uses a **Stack**. The stack is used to store the indices of characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:** The stack is initialized with a base value of **-1**. This value acts as an anchor for calculating the length of the first valid substring found.\n",
    "2.  **Iterating through the string $S$:**\n",
    "    * **If $S[i]$ is '(':** Push its index $i$ onto the stack.\n",
    "    * **If $S[i]$ is ')':** Pop the top element from the stack.\n",
    "        * **If the stack becomes empty:** This means the current ')' doesn't have a matching '(', or it closes a substring that started from the initial base. We push the current index $i$ back onto the stack to act as the new base/anchor for future calculations.\n",
    "        * **If the stack is not empty:** The current top of the stack, $k$, is the index of the last unmatched '('. The length of the valid substring ending at $i$ is calculated as $i - \\text{stack.top()}$. We continuously update the maximum length found so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "This stack mechanism elegantly handles nesting and disjoint valid substrings by using the anchor index to define the boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Two-Pointer (Linear Scan) Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "A non-extra-space solution involves a linear scan using two counters, `left` and `right`, for the number of opening and closing parentheses, respectively. We scan the string *twice*:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Left-to-Right Scan:** Iterate from $i=0$ to $N-1$. Increment `left` for '(' and `right` for ')'.\n",
    "    * If `left == right`: A valid substring is found, and its length is $2 \\times \\text{right}$. Update the maximum length.\n",
    "    * If `right > left`: The string is invalid, and we reset both counters to 0, because any valid substring must start anew after this point.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Right-to-Left Scan:** Iterate from $i=N-1$ to 0. This is necessary to catch cases like `(()`. The first scan misses the valid `()` because `left` is always greater than `right` until the end. We repeat the same logic, but with the condition $left > right$ triggering a reset.\n",
    "    * If `left == right`: Update max length $2 \\times \\text{left}$.\n",
    "    * If `left > right`: Reset both counters to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "All three methods (DP, Stack, and Two-Pointer) achieve the optimal time complexity:\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** $O(N)$, where $N$ is the length of the string, as each character is processed a constant number of times.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:**\n",
    "    * **DP and Stack:** $O(N)$ auxiliary space for the DP array or the stack.\n",
    "    * **Two-Pointer (Linear Scan):** $O(1)$ auxiliary space, as only a few counters are used. The Two-Pointer method is thus the most space-efficient solution."
