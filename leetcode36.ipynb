    "The LeetCode problem 36, \"Valid Sudoku,\" requires determining if a $9 \\times 9$ Sudoku board is valid based on three core rules. Crucially, the problem only asks to check if the current configuration is valid **structurally**; it does *not* ask whether the board is solvable. The input board contains digits '1'-'9' and the character '.' to represent empty cells. Only the filled cells need to be validated.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### **The Three Sudoku Rules for Validity**\n",
    "\n",
    "A partially filled Sudoku board is considered valid if the following three conditions hold true for all filled cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Row Constraint:** Each row must contain the digits '1'-'9' only once. That is, no duplicate digits can appear in any single row.\n",
    "2.  **Column Constraint:** Each column must contain the digits '1'-'9' only once. No duplicate digits can appear in any single column.\n",
    "3.  **Sub-box Constraint:** Each of the nine $3 \\times 3$ sub-boxes (or \"blocks\") must contain the digits '1'-'9' only once. No duplicate digits can appear within the boundaries of any $3 \\times 3$ block.\n",
    "\n",
    "The '.' characters (empty cells) are ignored during the validation process. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Efficient Strategy: Hash Sets for Frequency Tracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach would be to iterate through the board multiple times (once for each row, once for each column, and once for each sub-box), which is inefficient. The optimal and most common strategy is to use **Hash Sets** (or frequency arrays, if memory is restricted) to track the presence of digits, performing the validation in a single pass over the board. We need $9$ hash sets for the rows, $9$ for the columns, and $9$ for the sub-boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Data Structure Initialization**\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use three separate collections of hash sets:\n",
    "1.  `row_sets`: A list of 9 hash sets, where `row_sets[r]` stores the digits seen in row $r$.\n",
    "2.  `col_sets`: A list of 9 hash sets, where `col_sets[c]` stores the digits seen in column $c$.\n",
    "3.  `box_sets`: A list of 9 hash sets, where `box_sets[b]` stores the digits seen in box $b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of hash sets required is $9 + 9 + 9 = 27$. We initialize all these sets to be empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Single Pass Iteration and Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through the $9 \\times 9$ board cell by cell, using nested loops with row index $r$ and column index $c$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Check for Empty Cell:** If the current cell $board[r][c]$ is '.', we skip it and continue to the next cell.\n",
    "2.  **Extract Digit:** If the cell contains a digit $d$, we proceed to check the three constraints.\n",
    "3.  **Box Index Calculation:** The most crucial step is to correctly identify the index of the $3 \\times 3$ sub-box to which the cell $(r, c)$ belongs. The box index $b$ can be calculated using the formula:\n",
    "    $$b = \\left(\\frac{r}{3}\\right) \\times 3 + \\left(\\frac{c}{3}\\right)$$\n",
    "    The integer division $\\lfloor r/3 \\rfloor$ gives the vertical position of the block group (0, 1, or 2), and $\\lfloor c/3 \\rfloor$ gives the horizontal position (0, 1, or 2). This formula maps the 81 cells to one of the 9 box indices from 0 to 8.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Duplicate Check and Update**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the current digit $d$ at cell $(r, c)$, we check its presence in the corresponding hash sets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Row Check:** Check if $d$ is already in `row_sets[r]`. If present, return `False`. Otherwise, add $d$ to `row_sets[r]`.\n",
    "2.  **Column Check:** Check if $d$ is already in `col_sets[c]`. If present, return `False`. Otherwise, add $d$ to `col_sets[c]`.\n",
    "3.  **Box Check:** Check if $d$ is already in `box_sets[b]`. If present, return `False`. Otherwise, add $d$ to `box_sets[b]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the entire board is scanned without returning `False`, it means all filled cells adhere to the three rules, and we return `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The algorithm iterates through the $N^2$ cells of the board (where $N=9$) exactly once. For each cell, the check and insertion into the hash sets takes $O(1)$ time on average. Therefore, the overall time complexity is $O(N^2)$, which is $O(81)$, effectively constant time $O(1)$ for a fixed $9 \\times 9$ board size, or $O(N^2)$ if the board size were a variable $N$.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The algorithm requires 27 hash sets to store at most $9$ distinct digits each. Since the space used is constant and does not scale with the size of the board beyond $9 \\times 9$, the space complexity is $O(1)$."
