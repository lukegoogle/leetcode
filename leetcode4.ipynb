    "## 📊 LeetCode Problem 4: Median of Two Sorted Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 4, \"Median of Two Sorted Arrays,\" is significantly more challenging than the first three, requiring an understanding of both sorted arrays and logarithmic time complexity. It asks you to find the median of two separate sorted arrays, $nums1$ and $nums2$, after they have been conceptually merged, without actually merging them. The most crucial constraint is to achieve a time complexity of $O(\\log(m+n))$, where $m$ and $n$ are the sizes of the two arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 The Median and Merging\n",
    "\n",
    "The median of a sorted list of numbers is the middle element (if the total number of elements is odd) or the average of the two middle elements (if the total number of elements is even). A simple, but too slow, approach would be to merge the two sorted arrays into a new single array, $O(m+n)$, and then find the median. This linear time complexity violates the required logarithmic constraint. The $O(\\log(m+n))$ requirement strongly suggests using a **binary search** approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✨ The Partition Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is that finding the median is equivalent to finding a way to **partition** both arrays such that: 1) Every element in the left partition (from both arrays combined) is less than or equal to every element in the right partition (from both arrays combined). 2) The total number of elements in the left partition equals the total number of elements required to form the median position(s). If the total length $m+n$ is $K$, we need $\\lceil K/2 \\rceil$ elements in the left partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Binary Search on the Smaller Array\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the logarithmic time complexity, we perform a **binary search** on the *smaller* of the two arrays (say $nums1$ with length $m$). We try to find the perfect **cut point** $i$ in $nums1$. If we choose $i$ elements from $nums1$'s left side, then the required number of elements from $nums2$'s left side, say $j$, is fixed by the total desired left partition size: $j = (\\lceil (m+n)/2 \\rceil) - i$. The binary search adjusts the cut $i$ (and thus $j$) until the perfect partition is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ The Correct Partition Condition\n",
    "\n",
    "The partition is correct if two critical conditions are met: 1) The last element of the left partition of $nums1$ ($nums1[i-1]$) is less than or equal to the first element of the right partition of $nums2$ ($nums2[j]$). 2) The last element of the left partition of $nums2$ ($nums2[j-1]$) is less than or equal to the first element of the right partition of $nums1$ ($nums1[i]$). If these hold, we have found the correct four boundary elements. The median is then determined by the largest element in the combined left partition and the smallest element in the combined right partition, taking the average if $m+n$ is even.  If the conditions are not met, the binary search range in $nums1$ is adjusted (left or right) until the correct cut is found, resulting in the required $O(\\log(\\min(m, n)))$ time complexity."
