    "## 🗺️ LeetCode Problem 52: N-Queens II Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 52, titled \"N-Queens II,\" is a classic computational problem that belongs to the category of **backtracking**, a general algorithmic technique for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problems, notably constraint satisfaction problems. This problem is a direct follow-up and simplification of \"N-Queens\" (Problem 51). The core task is to determine the **number of distinct ways** to place $N$ non-attacking queens on an $N \\times N$ chessboard. Since the goal is only the count, not the actual board configurations, the complexity is slightly reduced compared to Problem 51, though the underlying search space remains identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental constraint is that no two queens can attack each other. In chess, a queen can attack horizontally, vertically, and diagonally. Therefore, in a valid configuration, **no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal**. Placing one queen in each row naturally satisfies the row constraint. Thus, a solution involves placing exactly one queen in each of the $N$ rows. The backtracking algorithm will iteratively attempt to place a queen in a column of the current row, provided that the column and the two associated diagonals are not already occupied by a previously placed queen.  This constraint-checking is the central performance consideration of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking approach typically utilizes a **Depth First Search (DFS)** mechanism. We start with the first row (row 0) and try to place a queen in every available column. If a column is valid (not attacked), we tentatively place a queen there and then recursively call the function to move to the next row (row 1). The 'state' of the search is defined by the current row we are trying to fill. A key piece of state is a global or passed-by-reference counter initialized to zero. The base case for the recursion is reached when we have successfully placed $N$ queens, meaning the current row index equals $N$. When the base case is hit, we have found a valid solution, and we increment the solution counter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently check the constraints, we need a way to track which columns and diagonals are occupied **without** having to iterate over all previously placed queens in every step. For an $N \\times N$ board, we need to track $N$ columns, $2N-1$ main (or positive slope) diagonals, and $2N-1$ anti (or negative slope) diagonals. The columns can be tracked with a simple boolean array of size $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagonals require a more clever index mapping. For a square at position $(row, col)$, all squares on the **main diagonal** (top-left to bottom-right, slope +1) share the same value for the difference $(row - col)$. This difference ranges from $-(N-1)$ to $(N-1)$. To use a zero-indexed array of size $2N-1$, we map this difference by adding $N-1$ (index $row - col + N - 1$). Similarly, all squares on the **anti-diagonal** (top-right to bottom-left, slope -1) share the same value for the sum $(row + col)$. This sum ranges from $0$ to $2(N-1)$, which directly maps to an array of size $2N-1$ (index $row + col$). This $O(1)$ look-up for all constraints is crucial for the algorithm's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual implementation of the recursive DFS function, typically named `solve(row)`, iterates through every column $j$ from $0$ to $N-1$ in the current `row`. Before placing a queen at $(row, j)$, it checks the three necessary conditions instantly using the tracking arrays: `is_column_free[j]`, `is_main_diagonal_free[row - j + N - 1]`, and `is_anti_diagonal_free[row + j]`. If all three constraints are satisfied (i.e., the indices are marked as free), the queen is tentatively placed: the tracking array entries are marked as occupied (`true`), and the recursive call `solve(row + 1)` is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical step that defines backtracking is the process of **retraction** or **un-doing** the choice. After the recursive call `solve(row + 1)` returns—signifying that the entire branch stemming from the current placement has been fully explored—the algorithm must backtrack. This involves removing the queen by setting the tracking array entries (for column $j$, main diagonal $row - j + N - 1$, and anti-diagonal $row + j$) back to free (`false`). This ensures that the state of the board is correctly reset before the loop moves to the next column $j+1$ in the current row, allowing the search to explore all alternative placements exhaustively. The total number of times the base case is reached gives the final count of distinct solutions."
