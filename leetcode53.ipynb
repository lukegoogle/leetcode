    "## 💡 LeetCode Problem 53: Maximum Subarray Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 53, \"Maximum Subarray,\" is a foundational algorithm question that asks for the largest sum of any **contiguous subarray** within a given integer array $\\text{nums}$. A contiguous subarray is a sequence of elements that are adjacent in the original array. For example, in the array $[1, -2, 3, 4, -1]$, $[3, 4]$ is a contiguous subarray, but $[1, 3, -1]$ is not. The challenge lies in efficiently finding the subarray whose elements sum up to the greatest possible value, even when the array contains negative numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive approach to solving this problem would be **brute force**. This involves checking every possible contiguous subarray. Since a subarray is defined by its start index $i$ and end index $j$ (where $0 \\le i \\le j < N$, with $N$ being the array length), there are $\\frac{N(N+1)}{2}$ such subarrays. For each subarray, we calculate its sum. This results in a time complexity of $O(N^3)$ if we recalculate the sum for every $(i, j)$ pair, or $O(N^2)$ if we use prefix sums or calculate the sum in an $O(1)$ or $O(N)$ nested loop manner. While simple to conceptualize, for large arrays, this approach is too slow, prompting the need for a more efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient and canonical solution uses **Kadane's Algorithm**, a dynamic programming (DP) technique that solves the problem in $O(N)$ time complexity. Kadane's algorithm iterates through the array once, maintaining two key variables: one to track the maximum sum found so far for any subarray ending at the current position, and another to track the overall maximum sum found across the entire array traversal. This method leverages the optimal substructure property inherent in DP problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formally define the variables for Kadane's Algorithm. We can define the DP state, $D_i$, as the **maximum subarray sum ending at index $i$**. The recurrence relation for $D_i$ is determined by the decision at index $i$: either the element $\\text{nums}[i]$ starts a new maximum subarray, or it extends the maximum subarray that ended at index $i-1$. Therefore, the optimal choice is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_i = \\max(\\text{nums}[i], \\text{nums}[i] + D_{i-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall solution to the problem, the maximum contiguous subarray sum, is then the maximum value across all $D_i$ for $0 \\le i < N$. That is, $\\text{OverallMax} = \\max_{i} (D_i)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In a practical, space-optimized implementation of Kadane's algorithm, we do not need to store the entire $D$ array. We can use a single variable, often called `current_max`, to represent the $D_i$ value for the current iteration. This variable tracks the maximum sum of a subarray that **must** end at the current index. We also maintain a second variable, `global_max`, which tracks the largest sum encountered anywhere in the array so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds as follows: Initialize both `current_max` and `global_max` to the first element of the array, $\\text{nums}[0]$. Then, iterate from the second element (index $i=1$) to the end of the array. In each iteration, update `current_max` using the recurrence relation: $\\text{current\\_max} = \\max(\\text{nums}[i], \\text{nums}[i] + \\text{current\\_max})$. This efficiently decides whether to extend the previous best subarray or to start a new one. Immediately after updating `current\\_max`, update `global\\_max`: $\\text{global\\_max} = \\max(\\text{global\\_max}, \\text{current\\_max})$. This ensures that `global_max` always holds the largest subarray sum found up to that point. The final value of `global_max` after the loop completes is the answer. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The elegance of Kadane's algorithm lies in its ability to discard negative running sums. If the `current_max` becomes negative, it means that any future subarray extending from this point will always be larger if it starts fresh from the next element, rather than including the current negative `current_max`. This is implicitly handled by the $\\max(\\text{nums}[i], \\text{nums}[i] + \\text{current\\_max})$ step, as $\\text{nums}[i]$ will be selected if $\\text{current\\_max}$ is negative enough to make the sum smaller than starting over. This critical insight allows for the efficient $O(N)$ time complexity with $O(1)$ extra space, making it the standard solution for the maximum subarray problem."
