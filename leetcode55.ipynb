    "## 🏃 LeetCode Problem 55: Jump Game Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 55, \"Jump Game,\" presents a scenario where you are given an integer array $\\text{nums}$, where each element $\\text{nums}[i]$ represents the maximum length you can jump forward from index $i$. The objective is to determine whether you can reach the last index (index $N-1$) starting from the first index (index $0$). This problem can be solved using several approaches, but the most efficient is a greedy algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple but often inefficient approach is **Depth First Search (DFS) with memoization** or **Dynamic Programming (DP)**. The DP state could be defined as $D_i$, which is a boolean value indicating whether index $i$ is reachable from the starting index $0$. The transition would be: $D_i$ is true if there exists some index $j < i$ such that $D_j$ is true and $j + \\text{nums}[j] \\ge i$. This approach iterates through all possible previous indices for every position, resulting in an $O(N^2)$ time complexity. While correct, it is generally too slow for large inputs, and for this specific problem, there is a much faster $O(N)$ solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The most efficient and recommended solution is the **Greedy Approach**. The key insight of the greedy strategy is to focus on the **farthest reachable index** from the beginning of the array. As we iterate through the array, we maintain a variable, let's call it `max_reach`, which stores the maximum index we can currently jump to.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm begins by initializing `max_reach` to $0$. We then iterate through the array using an index $i$ from $0$ up to $N-1$. Before calculating the new potential reach, we first check if the current index $i$ itself is reachable. If $i > \\text{max\\_reach}$, it means we are at an index that we could not reach from any of the preceding positions, making it impossible to continue forward. If this condition is met, we immediately return $\\text{false}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the current index $i$ is reachable, we calculate the farthest index we can jump to from $i$: this is $i + \\text{nums}[i]$. We then update `max_reach` by taking the maximum of its current value and this new potential reach: $\\text{max\\_reach} = \\max(\\text{max\\_reach}, i + \\text{nums}[i])$. This ensures that `max_reach` always holds the farthest index we have managed to reach so far. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "During the iteration, we also need to check if we have reached or surpassed the target, which is the last index $N-1$. If $\\text{max\\_reach} \\ge N - 1$, it means the last index is reachable, and we can immediately return $\\text{true}$ without needing to complete the rest of the loop. This check serves as an early exit condition, potentially speeding up the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy algorithm terminates when either we break out of the loop because $i > \\text{max\\_reach}$ (meaning the end is unreachable), or when the loop completes. If the loop completes without an early $\\text{true}$ return, the final determination depends on the state of `max_reach`. However, due to the $i \\le \\text{max\\_reach}$ check, if the loop finishes, it implies that the last element was successfully reached *or* the array was empty (which is handled by initial checks). For a standard non-empty array, the loop implicitly covers all steps, and the final check $\\text{max\\_reach} \\ge N - 1$ or the early exit based on it provides the correct $O(N)$ time complexity and $O(1)$ space complexity solution."
