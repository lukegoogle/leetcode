    "## 🧩 LeetCode Problem 56: Merge Intervals Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 56, \"Merge Intervals,\" is a widely encountered problem that involves manipulating a list of intervals, where each interval is represented as a pair of integers, $[\\text{start}, \\text{end}]$. The goal is to merge all overlapping intervals and return a new list containing the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the original intervals. For instance, if the input is $[[1, 3], [2, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]$, the intervals $[1, 3]$ and $[2, 6]$ overlap and are merged into $[1, 6]$, yielding the final result $[[1, 6], [8, 10], [15, 18]]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The necessity for merging arises when two intervals share at least one common point. Formally, two intervals $[a, b]$ and $[c, d]$ overlap if $\\max(a, c) \\le \\min(b, d)$. The merged interval would then be $[\\min(a, c), \\max(b, d)]$. A brute-force approach would be to check every pair of intervals for overlap, merging them, and then repeating the process until no more mergers are possible. This iterative pairwise checking can be highly inefficient, potentially leading to an $O(N^2)$ time complexity in the worst case, making it unsuitable for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficient and standard approach to solving the Merge Intervals problem relies on **sorting**. The key insight is that if the intervals are sorted by their start times, we only need to compare an interval with the one immediately following it to check for a potential overlap. If an interval $[a, b]$ overlaps with $[c, d]$, where $a \\le c$ due to sorting, the condition for overlap simplifies to $c \\le b$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The first and most crucial step is to **sort the input list of intervals based on their start times** in non-decreasing order. If the start times are the same, sorting by end times is secondary but usually doesn't affect the correctness of the final merging logic. Sorting the $N$ intervals takes $O(N \\log N)$ time, which dominates the overall time complexity of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "After sorting, the algorithm proceeds with a single pass through the array. We initialize a result list with the first interval. Then, for every subsequent interval, we compare its start time with the end time of the **last interval currently in the result list**. Let the last merged interval in the result list be $\\text{last} = [\\text{last\\_start}, \\text{last\\_end}]$, and the current interval being examined be $\\text{current} = [\\text{current\\_start}, \\text{current\\_end}]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two possible cases at each step: **Overlap** or **No Overlap**. **Case 1: Overlap.** If $\\text{current\\_start} \\le \\text{last\\_end}$, an overlap exists. Since the list is sorted by start times, we know $\\text{last\\_start} \\le \\text{current\\_start}$. To merge the intervals, we simply update the end time of the $\\text{last}$ interval in the result list to be the maximum of $\\text{last\\_end}$ and $\\text{current\\_end}$: $\\text{last\\_end} = \\max(\\text{last\\_end}, \\text{current\\_end})$. This effectively absorbs the current interval into the last merged one. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case 2: No Overlap.** If $\\text{current\\_start} > \\text{last\\_end}$, there is a gap between the last merged interval and the current interval. This means the current interval cannot be merged with any previous intervals. Therefore, the $\\text{last}$ interval is complete and finalized. We then add the $\\text{current}$ interval to the result list, and it now becomes the new interval to check for future overlaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The single-pass iteration through the sorted array takes $O(N)$ time. Since the initial sorting takes $O(N \\log N)$ time, the overall time complexity of the Merge Intervals algorithm is $O(N \\log N)$. The space complexity is $O(N)$ to store the result list, and potentially $O(\\log N)$ or $O(N)$ for the sorting algorithm, depending on the implementation. This approach is highly efficient and provides the standard solution to the problem."
