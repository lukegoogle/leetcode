    "## 🔢 LeetCode Problem 60: Permutation Sequence Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 60, \"Permutation Sequence,\" asks for the $k$-th lexicographically ordered permutation of the sequence of numbers $[1, 2, 3, \\dots, N]$. The problem states that for a set of $N$ distinct numbers, there are $N!$ total permutations. Given $N$ and $K$, the goal is to find the specific string representing the $k$-th permutation when all permutations are listed in increasing (lexicographical) order. For example, for $N=3$ and $K=3$, the permutations are $123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321$. The 3rd permutation is \"213.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach would be to generate all $N!$ permutations of the sequence using standard backtracking (like the common permutation algorithms) and then stop and return the $k$-th one. However, since $N$ can be up to 9 or 10, $N!$ grows very rapidly (e.g., $10! = 3,628,800$). If $K$ is close to $N!$, this approach would be highly inefficient, generating a huge number of permutations before reaching the target. A more sophisticated, mathematical approach is required to construct the $k$-th permutation directly, avoiding the need to generate the preceding ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The efficient solution relies on the **properties of factorials and block-based counting**. The $N!$ total permutations can be divided into $N$ main blocks, each of size $(N-1)!$. Each of these blocks starts with a distinct number from the set. For instance, in the $N=4$ case ($4! = 24$ permutations), there are four blocks of $3! = 6$ permutations each: those starting with '1', those starting with '2', those starting with '3', and those starting with '4'.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm iteratively determines the digit for each position of the $k$-th permutation, from left to right. Before starting, we pre-calculate the factorials from $1!$ up to $(N-1)!$ and maintain a list of available numbers, $\\text{candidates} = [1, 2, \\dots, N]$. The variable $K$ must be adjusted from $1$-based indexing to $0$-based indexing, so we start by setting $K = K - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the digit for the first position, we calculate the size of the blocks using $P = (N-1)!$. The index of the first digit in the current $\\text{candidates}$ list is determined by the quotient of the $0$-indexed $K$ and the block size $P$: $\\text{index} = \\lfloor K / P \\rfloor$. The digit at $\\text{candidates}[\\text{index}]$ is the correct first digit of the $k$-th permutation. This digit is appended to the result string and then **removed** from the $\\text{candidates}$ list. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "After selecting the digit, we update $K$ for the next iteration to find the remaining digits. The new $K$ is the remainder after the division: $K = K \\pmod P$. This new $K$ represents the relative position within the newly selected, smaller block of permutations. The block size $P$ is also updated for the next iteration: since we are now dealing with $N-1$ remaining digits, the new block size will be $(N-2)!$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "We repeat this process $N$ times. In the second iteration, we find the digit for the second position using $P = (N-2)!$ and the updated $K$. We determine the index, select the digit from the remaining $\\text{candidates}$, append it to the result, remove it from the list, update $K$, and update $P$. This iterative division and remainder calculation (often called the **Cantor Expansion** concept) efficiently maps the $k$-th index to the unique combination of choices that form the desired permutation string. This method has a time complexity of $O(N^2)$ due to the list removal operation (or $O(N)$ if a linked list is used, or a more complex $O(N)$ with an array and index tracking), which is significantly faster than the $O(N \\cdot N!)$ complexity of generating all permutations."
