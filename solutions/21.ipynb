    "LeetCode Problem 21, \"Merge Two Sorted Lists,\" is a foundational problem in data structures that requires merging two pre-sorted **singly linked lists** into a single, combined, and sorted linked list. The critical requirement is to perform the merge by **splicing together the existing nodes** from the input lists rather than creating entirely new nodes or simply copying the values into a new structure. The function must return the head of this newly formed sorted list. This problem is a classic application of the merge step in the Merge Sort algorithm and is essential for understanding linked list manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Understanding the Constraints and Goal**\n",
    "\n",
    "The input consists of two linked list heads, `list1` and `list2`. Both lists are guaranteed to be sorted in **non-decreasing order**. The number of nodes can range from 0 (an empty list) to 50, and node values are within a specified range. The output must be a single linked list that contains all nodes from both input lists, also sorted in non-decreasing order. The core challenge is the efficient rearrangement of the `next` pointers to achieve the merged order while maintaining a linear time complexity, $O(m+n)$, where $m$ and $n$ are the lengths of the two lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Iterative Approach: Using a Dummy Node**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and robust approach is an iterative solution utilizing a **dummy node** (sometimes called a sentinel node). A dummy node is a temporary head node created before the actual list begins. Its purpose is to simplify the code by providing a consistent starting point, eliminating the need for special handling of inserting the very first node (which would otherwise be a common edge case).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Initialization:** Create a `dummy` `ListNode` (e.g., with value 0, as its value is irrelevant) and a `current` pointer, initially set to point to this `dummy` node. This `current` pointer will track the tail of the newly forming merged list. \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Merging Loop:** A `while` loop runs as long as *both* `list1` and `list2` have nodes remaining. Inside the loop, the current nodes of `list1` and `list2` are compared based on their `val` (value) attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Splicing Logic:**\n",
    "    * If `list1.val` is less than or equal to `list2.val`, the node from `list1` is chosen. The `current.next` pointer is set to point to `list1`, effectively attaching `list1`'s current node to the merged list.\n",
    "    * Otherwise (if `list2.val` is smaller), the node from `list2` is chosen, and `current.next` is set to point to `list2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Advancement:** After splicing the chosen node, the `current` pointer is moved forward to this newly attached node (`current = current.next`), and the pointer of the list from which the node was taken (either `list1` or `list2`) is advanced to its next node (e.g., `list1 = list1.next`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Remaining Nodes and Final Return**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main `while` loop terminates when at least one of the lists becomes empty (i.e., reaches `null`). Since the nodes are compared one by one, the remaining nodes in the non-empty list are guaranteed to be larger than all the nodes already placed in the merged list and are themselves already sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Tail Appending:** After the loop, a final step is needed to append the remaining tail of the non-empty list to the merged list. This is done by setting `current.next` to the remaining part of `list1` *or* `list2`. Since at most one list can be non-empty, a simple conditional statement or a language-specific ternary operator handles this check (e.g., `current.next = list1 ? list1 : list2`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Result:** Finally, the head of the completely merged list is returned. Since the `dummy` node was only a placeholder, the actual head is the node *following* the dummy node, which is `dummy.next`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Alternative: The Recursive Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "A more concise, albeit sometimes less intuitive, solution uses **recursion**. The recursive approach exploits the self-similar nature of the problem: merging two lists is equivalent to choosing the smaller head node and then recursively merging the *rest* of that list with the *other* entire list.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:** The recursion must stop when one list is empty. If `list1` is `null`, return `list2`; if `list2` is `null`, return `list1`. If both are `null`, return `null`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Step:**\n",
    "    * If `list1.val` is less than or equal to `list2.val`, `list1`'s head is the next node in the merged list. We set `list1.next` to the result of recursively merging the *rest* of `list1` (`list1.next`) with the *entire* `list2`. Then, `list1` is returned as the head of this merged sub-problem.\n",
    "    * Otherwise, `list2`'s head is chosen. We set `list2.next` to the result of recursively merging the *entire* `list1` with the *rest* of `list2` (`list2.next`). Then, `list2` is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Complexity:** While elegant, the recursive solution introduces an overhead due to function calls, and the call stack depth can reach $O(m+n)$, leading to $O(m+n)$ space complexity in the worst case. The iterative approach, by contrast, uses only $O(1)$ extra space (for the dummy node and pointers). Both solutions maintain the required $O(m+n)$ time complexity.\n",
