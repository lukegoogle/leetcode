    "The LeetCode problem 31, \"Next Permutation,\" asks us to find the lexicographically next greater permutation of a given list of numbers (an array). If no such greater permutation exists, the array must be rearranged into the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order). The modification must be done **in-place** and only use constant extra memory. This problem is a classic application of combinatorial logic and array manipulation.\n",

    "### **Understanding Lexicographical Ordering**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lexicographical order, or dictionary order, is the standard way of ordering sequences. The \"next greater permutation\" is the smallest permutation that is strictly larger than the current one. For example, the permutations of $[1, 2, 3]$ in order are: $[1, 2, 3]$, then $[1, 3, 2]$, then $[2, 1, 3]$, then $[2, 3, 1]$, then $[3, 1, 2]$, and finally $[3, 2, 1]$. If the current array is $[1, 3, 2]$, the next greater permutation is $[2, 1, 3]$. If the array is already the largest possible permutation (e.g., $[3, 2, 1]$), the next one is the smallest: $[1, 2, 3]$.\n",

    "### **The Algorithm's Core Logic: Finding the Pivot**\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire algorithm hinges on finding the **pivot point**, which is the point of change that allows us to find the next larger permutation. The process involves four main steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Find the Breaking Point (Pivot Index $i$):** Scan the array from right to left. We look for the first index $i$ such that $nums[i] < nums[i+1]$. This index $i$ is our pivot. The suffix of the array starting from $i+1$ must already be sorted in descending order (the largest possible permutation for that suffix). Finding $i$ means we have found the smallest element from the right that can be increased.\n",
    "    * Example: In $[6, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 0]$, the pivot is $1$ at index $i=2$, because $1 < 5$. The suffix $[5, 4, 3, 0]$ is descending.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling the Largest Permutation Case**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we scan the entire array from right to left and do not find any index $i$ such that $nums[i] < nums[i+1]$ (i.e., the loop completes with $i = -1$), it means the entire array is sorted in descending order (e.g., $[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]$). This is the largest possible permutation. In this case, the problem requires us to rearrange the array to the lowest possible order, which is simply sorting it in ascending order (reversing the entire array). \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Finding the Swap Candidate**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a pivot index $i$ is found, the next step is to find the element in the descending suffix (from $i+1$ to the end) that will be swapped with $nums[i]$. This element, let's call its index $j$, must be:\n",
    "1.  **Just Greater:** The smallest element in the suffix that is strictly greater than $nums[i]$.\n",
    "2.  **Found from Right:** Since the suffix is in descending order, we can scan from the rightmost element back towards $i+1$. The first element $nums[j]$ encountered such that $nums[j] > nums[i]$ is guaranteed to be the *smallest* element greater than $nums[i]$ in that suffix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Performing the Swap**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the pivot $i$ and the swap candidate $j$ are identified, we swap $nums[i]$ and $nums[j]$.\n",
    "* Example (cont.): In $[6, 2, 1, 5, 4, 3, 0]$, $i=2$ (value 1). The smallest element in $[5, 4, 3, 0]$ greater than 1 is 3 (at index $j=5$). We swap 1 and 3. The array becomes: $[6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 0]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This swap ensures that the new permutation is definitely greater than the original, as we increased the digit at index $i$ by the smallest possible amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reversing the Suffix**\n",
    "\n",
    "The final and most crucial step is to rearrange the suffix of the array starting from $i+1$. After the swap, the suffix (which was originally the largest permutation for those elements) must be rearranged to the **smallest** possible permutation for those new elements to ensure that the overall resulting permutation is the **next greater** one (the smallest increase). Since the elements in the suffix are still in descending order (except for the swapped element), simply reversing the elements from $i+1$ to the end achieves the smallest possible ordering (ascending order).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example (cont.): The array is $[6, 2, 3, 5, 4, 1, 0]$. We reverse the suffix $[5, 4, 1, 0]$. The final result is: $[6, 2, 3, 0, 1, 4, 5]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The algorithm involves a single pass from right to left to find the pivot ($O(N)$), a second pass to find the swap candidate ($O(N)$ in the worst case), and a final reversal of the suffix ($O(N)$). Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear, $O(N)$.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The problem requires the modification to be done in-place, and the algorithm only uses a few constant-size integer variables for indices and temporary storage for the swap. Thus, the space complexity is $O(1)$."
