    "The LeetCode problem 33, \"Search in Rotated Sorted Array,\" asks us to search for a target value in a sorted array that has been rotated at some unknown pivot point. For example, the array `[0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]` might become `[4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]`. The array remains sorted in two segments, but the overall continuous sorting is broken. The critical constraint is that the search must be performed in $O(\\log n)$ time complexity, which mandates the use of a modified **Binary Search** algorithm.\n",

    "### **The Challenge of Rotation**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a standard Binary Search, the midpoint comparison immediately tells us which half of the array to search because the array is entirely sorted. In a rotated array, the midpoint element might be greater than the rightmost element (indicating the rotation occurred in the right half) or less than the rightmost element (indicating the right half is sorted). The challenge is to determine, in each iteration, which of the two resulting halves is continuously sorted and whether the `target` must lie within that sorted half. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Modified Binary Search Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "We maintain the standard Binary Search pointers, `low` and `high`, defining the search space. In each iteration, we calculate the `mid` index. The key decision point is to determine which half of the array—from `low` to `mid` or from `mid` to `high`—is sorted. Since exactly one half must be sorted, we can check for one half, and if it's not sorted, the other must be. The most common check is: **Is the segment from `low` to `mid` sorted?**\n",

    "### **Determining the Sorted Half**\n",

    "\n",
    "1.  **Case 1: $nums[low] \\le nums[mid]$ (The left half is sorted)**:\n",
    "    This means the segment from `low` to `mid` is continuously sorted. We then check if the `target` falls within the range of this sorted segment: $nums[low] \\le target < nums[mid]$.\n",
    "    * **If Yes:** The target is in the left sorted half. We update $high = mid - 1$.\n",
    "    * **If No:** The target must be in the right (unsorted) half. We update $low = mid + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Case 2: $nums[low] > nums[mid]$ (The right half is sorted)**:\n",
    "    If the left half is not sorted, the rotation pivot must be in the left half, meaning the segment from `mid` to `high` is continuously sorted. We check if the `target` falls within the range of this sorted segment: $nums[mid] < target \\le nums[high]$.\n",
    "    * **If Yes:** The target is in the right sorted half. We update $low = mid + 1$.\n",
    "    * **If No:** The target must be in the left (unsorted) half. We update $high = mid - 1$.\n",

    "### **Iteration and Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop continues as long as $low \\le high$. If $nums[mid]$ is equal to the `target` at any point, we immediately return the `mid` index. If the loop completes without finding the `target`, it means the element is not present in the array, and we return $-1$.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified Binary Search maintains the core principle of halving the search space in every iteration.\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Since the search space is divided in half repeatedly, the time complexity is logarithmic, $O(\\log n)$, where $n$ is the number of elements in the array. This satisfies the problem's strict constraint.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses only a few constant-size integer variables for the pointers (`low`, `high`, `mid`), requiring $O(1)$ extra space.\n",
