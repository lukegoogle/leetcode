    "The LeetCode problem 39, \"Combination Sum,\" is a foundational problem in combinatorial optimization that requires finding all unique combinations of numbers from a given set (`candidates`) that sum up to a specific `target` number. The key distinguishing feature of this problem is that the same number in `candidates` may be chosen an **unlimited number of times** (repetition is allowed). The solution must not contain duplicate combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Approach: Backtracking with Recursion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the need to explore all valid combinations and the ability to reuse elements, the problem is best solved using a **Backtracking** algorithm implemented via Depth-First Search (DFS). Backtracking allows us to build a combination iteratively and prune the search space when a path becomes invalid (e.g., the current sum exceeds the `target`).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preparation and Pruning**\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical preliminary step for many backtracking combination problems is to **sort the `candidates` array**. Sorting enables two significant optimizations:\n",
    "1.  **Early Pruning:** If the current candidate number, when added to the current sum, already exceeds the `target`, we can immediately stop exploring the rest of the candidates, as they will only be larger.\n",
    "2.  **Duplicate Handling:** While not strictly necessary for this version (since duplicates are handled by how we advance the index), sorting ensures that identical recursive paths are simplified and manageable, particularly when solving related problems where duplicates are present in the input array itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The State of the Recursive Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive helper function, say `backtrack(start_index, current_sum, current_combination)`, needs to maintain the following state information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`start_index`:** An integer representing the index in the `candidates` array from which the search for the next element should begin. This pointer is crucial for avoiding duplicate combinations.\n",
    "2.  **`current_sum`:** The sum of all elements currently in the combination.\n",
    "3.  **`current_combination`:** A list or array storing the numbers chosen so far in the current path.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Base Cases and Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive function has two primary base cases that dictate when a path is terminated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Success Case:** If the `current_sum` is exactly equal to the `target`, a valid combination has been found. The `current_combination` is added to the final result list, and the recursion returns.\n",
    "2.  **Failure Case (Pruning):** If the `current_sum` exceeds the `target`, the current path cannot lead to a solution. The recursion immediately stops and returns without adding anything to the result, effectively pruning this branch of the search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Step (The Loop and Reusability)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main loop iterates through the `candidates` array, starting from the `start_index`. For each candidate element $C$ at index $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Choose:** The element $C$ is added to the `current_combination`, and the `current_sum` is updated.\n",
    "2.  **Recurse:** A recursive call is made: `backtrack(i, new_sum, new_combination)`. **Crucially**, the `start_index` passed to the next call is still $i$, not $i+1$. This is because the problem allows the **same element $C$ to be reused** an unlimited number of times.\n",
    "3.  **Unchoose (Backtrack):** After the recursive call returns (meaning that branch has been fully explored), the last added element $C$ is removed from the `current_combination`, and the `current_sum` is reverted. This resets the state for the next iteration of the loop, which will try the candidate at $i+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the `start_index` prevents duplicate combinations, such as generating $[2, 3]$ and then later $[3, 2]$, because once we choose 3, we only explore candidates at an index $\\ge 3$. However, since we use the current index $i$ in the recursive call, the current element is available for reuse. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Since the number of combinations can grow exponentially, the worst-case time complexity is challenging to define exactly but is generally described as $O(N^{T/C_{\\min}})$, where $N$ is the number of candidates, $T$ is the target, and $C_{\\min}$ is the smallest candidate value. A looser but safer bound is often cited as $O(N \\cdot 2^{T})$, reflecting the nature of the exponential search space.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is dominated by the storage needed for the final result list and the depth of the recursion stack. The maximum depth of the stack is $O(T / C_{\\min})$. Thus, the space complexity is $O(T / C_{\\min} + \\text{Number of Combinations} \\cdot L)$, where $L$ is the maximum length of a combination."
