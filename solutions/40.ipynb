    "The LeetCode problem 40, \"Combination Sum II,\" is a variation of the classic combination sum problem (Problem 39), requiring us to find all unique combinations of numbers from a given set (`candidates`) that sum up to a specific `target` number. The critical difference here is the constraint that **each number in the `candidates` array may be used only once** in a combination, and the input `candidates` array *may contain duplicate numbers*. This requires a more careful backtracking strategy to eliminate duplicate combinations in the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Challenge: Eliminating Output Duplicates**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input array `candidates` can contain duplicates (e.g., `[10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]`), a naive backtracking approach will produce duplicate combinations in the output. For example, if there are two '1's at indices 1 and 5, using `candidates[1]` followed by `candidates[5]` is distinct from using `candidates[5]` followed by `candidates[1]` in terms of indices, but they produce the same combination `[1, 1]`. The core solution lies in using **sorting and conditional skipping** within the backtracking loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Preparation: Sorting and Pruning**\n",
    "\n",
    "The essential first step is to **sort the `candidates` array**. Sorting enables two critical aspects of the solution:\n",
    "1.  **Early Pruning:** If the current candidate number, when added to the current sum, already exceeds the `target`, we can immediately break the loop, as all subsequent candidates will be larger.\n",
    "2.  **Duplicate Skipping:** Sorting brings identical numbers together, allowing us to easily identify and skip duplicates within the backtracking loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Backtracking State**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive helper function, typically named `backtrack(start_index, target_remaining, current_combination)`, must maintain the following state:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`start_index`:** An integer representing the index in the sorted `candidates` array from which the search for the next element should begin. This is crucial because **we must advance this index** by one after each choice to enforce the \"use only once\" rule for the current element.\n",
    "2.  **`target_remaining`:** The amount that still needs to be summed to reach the original `target`. This is often more convenient than tracking the running sum.\n",
    "3.  **`current_combination`:** The list storing the numbers chosen so far in the current path.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Base Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive function terminates based on two conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Success Case:** If `target_remaining` is exactly equal to 0, a valid combination has been found. The `current_combination` is added to the final result list, and the recursion returns.\n",
    "2.  **Failure Case (Pruning):** If `target_remaining` becomes less than 0, the current path has overshot the target. The recursion immediately stops and returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Unique Constraint: The Skip Condition**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key modification to the backtracking loop lies in the logic used to skip duplicate elements. The loop iterates from `start_index` to the end of the array. Within the loop, we check for duplicates:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{If } i > \\text{start\\_index and candidates}[i] == \\text{candidates}[i-1]:$$\n",
    "$$\\text{Continue (Skip this element)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic ensures that if an element is identical to the one immediately preceding it in the loop *and* the preceding element was not used in the current recursive level (which is guaranteed if $i > \\text{start\\_index}$), we skip the current element. This guarantees that for a group of identical numbers, say `[2, 2, 2]`, we only start a new combination path using the first '2'. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each non-skipped candidate element $C$ at index $i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Choose:** The element $C$ is added to the `current_combination`.\n",
    "2.  **Recurse:** A recursive call is made: `backtrack(i + 1, target_remaining - C, new_combination)`. **Crucially**, the `start_index` passed is $i+1$. Advancing the index ensures that the element at index $i$ is not considered again in the subsequent calls, enforcing the \"use only once\" per combination rule.\n",
    "3.  **Unchoose (Backtrack):** After the recursive call returns, the element $C$ is removed from the `current_combination`, and the state is reverted for the next iteration of the loop, which will try the candidate at $i+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining the sorting, the `i > start_index` skip condition, and the $i+1$ advancement, we guarantee that all unique combinations are found exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is still combinatorial and hard to define exactly due to the pruning, but it is generally considered to be $O(2^N)$, where $N$ is the number of candidates. This is because, in the worst case, each element can either be included or excluded from a combination. The sorting step adds an initial $O(N \\log N)$ complexity. The space complexity is determined by the size of the recursion stack, which is $O(N)$ for the deepest branch, and the space required to store the final list of combinations."
