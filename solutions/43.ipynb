    "The LeetCode problem 43, \"Multiply Strings,\" challenges us to multiply two non-negative integers represented as strings, `num1` and `num2`, and return their product, also as a string. The core constraint is the prohibition of using any built-in BigInteger libraries or direct conversion of the input strings to integers. This requires implementing the grade-school multiplication algorithm manually, handling the digits, carrying, and position management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Approach: Simulating Grade-School Multiplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input numbers can be arbitrarily large (too large to fit into standard integer types like 32-bit or 64-bit integers), we must treat the multiplication as a series of digit-by-digit operations, mimicking the long multiplication taught in school. When multiplying an $N$-digit number by an $M$-digit number, the result will have at most $N + M$ digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall process involves two main stages:\n",
    "1.  **Digit Multiplication:** Multiplying each digit of `num1` by each digit of `num2` and placing the result in its correct positional slot.\n",
    "2.  **Summation and Carry:** Summing up the intermediate products and handling the carry-overs to produce the final product string.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Product Array and Positional Mapping**\n",
    "\n",
    "To efficiently manage the intermediate products and their correct decimal places, we use an integer array, often called `pos` or `product_array`, of size $N+M$, where $N$ and $M$ are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`. This array will store the temporary results before final carries are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is the positional relationship: when multiplying `num1[i]` by `num2[j]`, the result contributes to two specific positions in the final product array:\n",
    "* **$p1$ (The Tens Place):** Corresponds to index $i + j$.\n",
    "* **$p2$ (The Units Place):** Corresponds to index $i + j + 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through `num1` from right to left (index $i$) and `num2` from right to left (index $j$), performing the multiplication $val = (\\text{num1}[i] - '0') \\times (\\text{num2}[j] - '0')$. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Intermediate Product Calculation and Carry Handling**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each pair of digits $(i, j)$:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Calculate Sum:** The result of the multiplication $val$ is added to the existing value at the units position $p2$ of the `product_array`: $\\text{sum} = val + \\text{product\\_array}[p2]$.\n",
    "2.  **Calculate New Carry:** The carry to the next higher place is $\\text{carry} = \\lfloor \\text{sum} / 10 \\rfloor$. This carry is added to the tens position $p1$: $\\text{product\\_array}[p1] += \\text{carry}$.\n",
    "3.  **Update Units Digit:** The new units digit for position $p2$ is $\\text{sum} \\bmod 10$: $\\text{product\\_array}[p2] = \\text{sum} \\bmod 10$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This simultaneous handling of the tens and units place automatically manages the cumulative carries across all intermediate multiplications, simplifying the final stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Final Result Construction**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the nested loops complete, the `product_array` contains all the digits of the final product, but they are still in integer form. The final step is to convert this array into the required string format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Skip Leading Zeros:** Iterate through the `product_array`. If the first digit is 0 (which happens if the product has less than $N+M$ digits, e.g., $2 \\times 3 = 6$), we skip it. We start appending digits to the result string from the first non-zero digit found.\n",
    "2.  **Handle Zero Product:** A critical edge case is when the product itself is 0 (e.g., \"0\" $\\times$ \"123\"). If the entire `product_array` consists only of zeros, the result should be simply \"0\".\n",
    "3.  **Append Digits:** Append the remaining integer digits from the `product_array` to a string builder or list, converting each integer back to its character representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The algorithm involves nested loops that iterate through the lengths of the two strings. The outer loop runs $N$ times, and the inner loop runs $M$ times. The constant-time arithmetic inside the loops dominates the complexity. Therefore, the time complexity is $O(N \\cdot M)$, where $N$ and $M$ are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses an auxiliary integer array of size $N+M$ to store the intermediate products. The space complexity is therefore $O(N + M)$, which is linear with respect to the maximum possible length of the result."
