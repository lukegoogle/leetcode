    "The LeetCode problem 50, \"Pow($x$, $n$),\" asks us to implement the function $\\text{pow}(x, n)$, which calculates $x$ raised to the power of $n$. This challenge is designed to test efficient exponentiation, particularly for large absolute values of $n$, while handling various edge cases, including negative exponents and the constraints of standard floating-point precision. A naive solution of multiplying $x$ by itself $n$ times is unacceptable due to its $O(n)$ time complexity.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Constraint: Logarithmic Time Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle large exponents efficiently, the required time complexity is $O(\\log |n|)$. This logarithmic efficiency is achieved by using the method of **Exponentiation by Squaring**, also known as the binary exponentiation algorithm. This technique relies on the algebraic properties of powers:\n",
    "1.  If $n$ is even, $x^n = (x^{n/2})^2$.\n",
    "2.  If $n$ is odd, $x^n = x \\cdot x^{n-1} = x \\cdot (x^{(n-1)/2})^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "By exploiting these properties, we can halve the exponent in each recursive or iterative step, drastically reducing the number of multiplications required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Negative Exponents and Base Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before applying the main algorithm, several edge cases must be addressed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Negative Exponent:** If $n$ is negative, $x^n = 1 / x^{-n}$. We convert the problem into calculating $x^{-n}$ and then take the reciprocal of the result. Crucially, due to integer limits, we must handle the case where $n = -2^{31}$ (the minimum integer), as its positive counterpart, $2^{31}$, cannot be represented in a standard 32-bit signed integer. The calculation must proceed with a larger integer type (like `long`) for the exponent or by adjusting the sign and taking the absolute value carefully.\n",
    "2.  **Base Cases:** If $n=0$, the result is 1 (for $x \\ne 0$). If $x=0$ and $n>0$, the result is 0. If $x=1$, the result is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Iterative Binary Exponentiation Algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative approach is generally preferred over recursion to avoid the overhead of the recursion stack. It efficiently processes the exponent $n$ bit by bit, moving from the least significant bit to the most significant bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Convert to Positive and Absolute Value:** As discussed, ensure the exponent $N$ is positive (by taking $|n|$ and handling the reciprocal later).\n",
    "2.  **Initialization:** Initialize the result variable, $ans = 1.0$.\n",
    "3.  **Looping through Bits:** Loop while $N > 0$.\n",
    "    * **Check the Last Bit:** If the least significant bit of $N$ is 1 (i.e., $N$ is odd), it means this power of $x$ contributes to the final product. We update $ans = ans \\times x$.\n",
    "    * **Square the Base:** We square the base $x$ for the next iteration: $x = x \\times x$. This is the \"squaring\" part of the algorithm, as we are accumulating powers of 2 (e.g., $x^1, x^2, x^4, x^8, \\dots$).\n",
    "    * **Right Shift the Exponent:** We divide the exponent by 2 (right bit-shift): $N = N / 2$ (or $N \\gg 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "This process extracts the necessary powers of $x$ corresponding to the set bits in the binary representation of $N$. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Final Reciprocal Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop completes, if the original exponent $n$ was negative, the calculated $ans$ is for $x^{|n|}$. We must take the reciprocal of the result: $ans = 1.0 / ans$. The final result is the accumulated value in $ans$. The careful handling of the minimum integer $n=-2^{31}$ using `long` ensures that the conversion to the positive exponent $|n|$ does not cause overflow before the loop begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** In each iteration of the loop, the exponent $N$ is halved. The number of iterations required to reduce $N$ to 0 is proportional to the number of bits in $N$, which is $\\log_2 N$. Since we perform a constant number of arithmetic operations in each step, the time complexity is $O(\\log |n|)$, satisfying the efficiency requirement.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The iterative solution uses only a few constant-size variables (`ans`, `x`, `N`) for calculation and storage. The space complexity is $O(1)$."
