    "## 🌀 LeetCode Problem 54: Spiral Matrix Explained\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 54, \"Spiral Matrix,\" asks you to traverse a given $m \\times n$ matrix in a spiral order and return all its elements in a single list. The spiral traversal starts at the top-left corner, moves right across the first row, then down the last column, then left across the last row, and finally up the first column, continually shrinking the boundaries until all elements are visited. This is a simulation problem that requires careful management of boundary conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and effective solution for the Spiral Matrix problem is to use a **boundary tracking** approach. This involves defining four variables to represent the current boundaries of the area that has *not yet* been traversed: `top` (starting row index), `bottom` (ending row index), `left` (starting column index), and `right` (ending column index). Initially, `top` is $0$, `bottom` is $m-1$, `left` is $0$, and `right` is $n-1$, where $m$ is the number of rows and $n$ is the number of columns. The algorithm proceeds in a loop, traversing one full layer of the spiral (four distinct directions) in each iteration, and then adjusting the boundaries inwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The core of the algorithm consists of four distinct steps within a `while` loop that continues as long as `top <= bottom` and `left <= right`. These conditions ensure that there is still a valid rectangular area left to traverse. The four steps correspond to the four directions of the spiral: **Right, Down, Left, Up**. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1: Traverse Right (Top Row):** We traverse the current `top` row from `left` column to `right` column. We add $\\text{matrix}[\\text{top}][j]$ to the result list for $j = \\text{left}$ to $\\text{right}$. Once this row is finished, we have effectively traversed the outermost top boundary, so we **increment `top`** ($\\text{top} = \\text{top} + 1$) to exclude this row from future traversal. After this step, a crucial check is needed: if $\\text{top} > \\text{bottom}$, it means we have exhausted all rows, and the loop must break.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2: Traverse Down (Right Column):** Assuming the loop hasn't broken, we now traverse the current `right` column from the new `top` row down to the `bottom` row. We add $\\text{matrix}[i][\\text{right}]$ to the result list for $i = \\text{top}$ to $\\text{bottom}$. This column is now complete, so we **decrement `right`** ($\\text{right} = \\text{right} - 1$) to move the right boundary inwards. Again, a boundary check is necessary: if $\\text{left} > \\text{right}$, it means we have exhausted all columns, and the loop must break.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3: Traverse Left (Bottom Row):** If the loop is still active, we traverse the current `bottom` row from the new `right` column back to the `left` column (in reverse order). We add $\\text{matrix}[\\text{bottom}][j]$ to the result list for $j = \\text{right}$ down to $\\text{left}$. This row is finished, so we **decrement `bottom`** ($\\text{bottom} = \\text{bottom} - 1$) to move the bottom boundary inwards. Note that the boundary checks after Step 1 and Step 2 are essential to prevent over-traversal, especially in $1 \\times n$ or $m \\times 1$ matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4: Traverse Up (Left Column):** Finally, we traverse the current `left` column from the new `bottom` row up to the new `top` row (in reverse order). We add $\\text{matrix}[i][\\text{left}]$ to the result list for $i = \\text{bottom}$ down to $\\text{top}$. This completes the spiral layer. We then **increment `left`** ($\\text{left} = \\text{left} + 1$) to move the left boundary inwards. After this step, the loop returns to the beginning to check the main boundary conditions (`top <= bottom` and `left <= right`) for the next, smaller inner layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "This method ensures that every element is visited exactly once, in the correct spiral order, resulting in an $O(m \\cdot n)$ time complexity, where $m \\cdot n$ is the total number of elements in the matrix, as we visit each element a constant number of times. The space complexity is $O(1)$ auxiliary space, not counting the space required to store the output list. The key to implementing this correctly lies in the precise boundary updates and the necessary break conditions after the horizontal (Right, Left) and vertical (Down, Up) sweeps to handle single-row or single-column scenarios gracefully."
