    "## 🏛️ LeetCode Problem 13: Roman to Integer - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 13, \"Roman to Integer,\" is the reverse of LeetCode 12, requiring the conversion of a given Roman numeral string $S$ into its corresponding integer value. This problem tests the ability to parse a string, manage sequential reading, and correctly implement the rules of the Roman numeral system, particularly the crucial **subtractive principle**, using an iterative approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Understanding the Roman Numeral Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roman numeral system is generally additive, meaning symbols are summed from left to right (e.g., $\\text{VI} = 5 + 1 = 6$). However, the system also uses a **subtractive principle** where a smaller value symbol immediately preceding a larger value symbol indicates subtraction. The six specific subtractive combinations are:\n",
    "1.  $\\text{IV}$ (4) and $\\text{IX}$ (9)\n",
    "2.  $\\text{XL}$ (40) and $\\text{XC}$ (90)\n",
    "3.  $\\text{CD}$ (400) and $\\text{CM}$ (900)\n",
    "\n",
    "The input string is guaranteed to be a valid Roman numeral representing a number between 1 and 3999, which simplifies the problem by removing the need for complex input validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 The Right-to-Left (Reverse) Iteration Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "The most elegant and efficient strategy to handle the subtractive rule without complex lookaheads is to **iterate through the Roman numeral string from right to left** (from the least significant to the most significant position). This approach is based on the observation that when reading from right to left, if the current symbol's value is **less than** the value of the symbol immediately to its right (the previously processed symbol), it must be part of a subtractive pair and should be subtracted from the total sum instead of added.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 Step-by-Step Algorithm Walkthrough\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm begins by initializing a running `total` sum to $0$. It also maintains a variable, `prev_value`, which stores the integer value of the last Roman symbol processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  A mapping (e.g., a hash map or dictionary) is used to quickly convert each Roman character to its integer value ($\\text{I} \\to 1, \\text{V} \\to 5, \\dots, \\text{M} \\to 1000$).\n",
    "2.  The algorithm loops through the input string $S$ backward, from the last character to the first.\n",
    "3.  In each iteration, the `current_value` of the current symbol $S[i]$ is retrieved from the map.\n",
    "4.  The core logic compares the `current_value` with the `prev_value`:\n",
    "    * **Additive Case (Current $\\ge$ Previous):** If `current_value` is greater than or equal to `prev_value`, the current symbol is part of an additive sequence, and its value is **added** to the `total`. (This is the case for most symbols).\n",
    "    * **Subtractive Case (Current $<$ Previous):** If `current_value` is strictly less than `prev_value`, the current symbol is the subtractive part (e.g., $\\text{I}$ in $\\text{IV}$). Its value is **subtracted** from the `total`.\n",
    "5.  After the addition or subtraction, the `prev_value` is updated to the `current_value` to prepare for the next iteration. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⏱️ Time Complexity and Efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "This right-to-left iteration is highly efficient and robust. Since the algorithm only makes a single pass over the string, and the work done inside the loop (map lookup, comparison, addition/subtraction) is $O(1)$ constant time, the overall time complexity is **$O(N)$**, where $N$ is the length of the Roman numeral string. Given the input constraint ($N$ is small, maximum length around 15 for 3999), the performance is excellent. The space complexity is $O(1)$ (or $O(N)$ if the input string is converted to a character array, but generally considered $O(1)$ for the fixed-size map)."
