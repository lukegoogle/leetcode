    "## 🎯 LeetCode Problem 15: 3Sum - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 15, \"3Sum,\" is a notoriously challenging array manipulation problem that requires finding all unique triplets $[a, b, c]$ in a given integer array $nums$ such that their sum equals zero ($a + b + c = 0$). This problem is the generalized version of the two-sum problem and is primarily focused on how to efficiently eliminate duplicate solutions and optimize the search from a cubic $O(N^3)$ approach down to a near-optimal quadratic $O(N^2)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧐 Brute-Force and The Duplication Hurdle\n",
    "\n",
    "A brute-force solution would involve using three nested loops to check every possible triplet $(i, j, k)$. This results in an immediate $O(N^3)$ time complexity, which is generally unacceptable for typical constraints. Furthermore, this method would generate numerous duplicate triplets. For example, if $nums = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]$, the triplets $[-1, 0, 1]$ and $[1, 0, -1]$ represent the same set of numbers and should only be counted once. The challenge is therefore two-fold: optimize the time complexity and ensure the uniqueness of the returned triplets.\n",

    "### 💡 The $O(N^2)$ Optimized Strategy: Sorting and Two Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective strategy to solve the 3Sum problem in $O(N^2)$ time leverages two key techniques: **sorting** and the **Two-Pointer Technique**.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Sorting ($O(N \\log N)$):** The array $nums$ is first sorted. Sorting is essential because it allows us to quickly skip duplicate numbers and enables the Two-Pointer Technique for efficient searching.\n",
    "2.  **Fixing One Element ($O(N)$):** We iterate through the sorted array using a single pointer $i$. The element $nums[i]$ is fixed as the first element of our potential triplet. The target sum for the remaining two elements becomes $target' = 0 - nums[i]$.\n",
    "3.  **Two Pointers for 2Sum ($O(N)$):** For each fixed $nums[i]$, the subproblem reduces to finding two numbers in the remaining subarray (from index $i+1$ to $N-1$) that sum up to $target'$. This is a classic 2Sum problem, which can be solved efficiently using two pointers, $L$ (starting at $i+1$) and $R$ (starting at $N-1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ➡️ The Two-Pointer Movement and Triplet Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "The two pointers, $L$ and $R$, move inward based on the sum $S = nums[L] + nums[R]$ compared to the required $target'$:\n",
    "1.  **If $S < target'$:** The sum is too small. To increase the sum, we must include a larger number, so the left pointer moves right: $L++$.\n",
    "2.  **If $S > target'$:** The sum is too large. To decrease the sum, we must include a smaller number, so the right pointer moves left: $R--$.\n",
    "3.  **If $S = target'$:** A valid triplet $[nums[i], nums[L], nums[R]]$ has been found. This triplet is added to the result list.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚫 Duplication Elimination: The Crucial Step\n",
    "\n",
    "Duplicate triplets must be carefully eliminated at two levels. This is where the sorting step becomes indispensable:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Skipping Duplicates for the Fixed Element ($nums[i]$):** After processing $nums[i]$, if the next element $nums[i+1]$ is the same as $nums[i]$, we skip $nums[i+1]$ by advancing $i$. This prevents processing the same first element multiple times.\n",
    "2.  **Skipping Duplicates within the Two-Pointer Search ($nums[L]$ and $nums[R]$):** After a valid triplet is found, we must move $L$ and $R$ past any duplicates to ensure the next valid triplet is unique. We increment $L$ as long as $nums[L] = nums[L-1]$ and $L < R$. Similarly, we decrement $R$ as long as $nums[R] = nums[R+1]$ and $L < R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall time complexity is dominated by the initial sort ($O(N \\log N)$) and the $N$ iterations of the outer loop, each containing a linear-time Two-Pointer search ($O(N)$). Thus, the total complexity is $O(N \\log N + N^2)$, which simplifies to **$O(N^2)$**. "
