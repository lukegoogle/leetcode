    "## 📱 LeetCode Problem 17: Letter Combinations of a Phone Number - In Immense Detail\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 17, \"Letter Combinations of a Phone Number,\" is a classic combinatorial problem that requires generating all possible letter combinations that the input digits (from 2 to 9 inclusive) could represent, based on a standard telephone keypad mapping. This problem is a fundamental exercise in understanding and implementing **backtracking** or **depth-first search (DFS)** algorithms to explore a search space defined by sequential choices.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧐 The Problem Mapping and Combinatorial Nature\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem defines a mapping from digits to letters, similar to old T9 keypads (e.g., '2' maps to \"abc\", '3' maps to \"def\", ..., '9' maps to \"wxyz\"). Given an input string of digits, say \"23\", the goal is to generate every possible string formed by choosing one letter from the set corresponding to the first digit and one letter from the set corresponding to the second digit. For \"23\", the combinations are \"ad\", \"ae\", \"af\", \"bd\", \"be\", \"bf\", \"cd\", \"ce\", \"cf\", resulting in $3 \\times 3 = 9$ combinations. If the input contains $N$ digits, and each digit maps to $M$ letters (where $M$ is typically 3 or 4), the total number of combinations is $M^N$.\n",

    "### 💡 The Backtracking / Depth-First Search Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "The most robust way to solve this is using a **backtracking** algorithm, which systematically builds up the combinations one character at a time. Backtracking is essentially a Depth-First Search (DFS) on the implicit decision tree defined by the input digits. Each digit in the input string represents a level in the tree, and the letters mapped to that digit represent the branches at that level.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm maintains a state, typically a current combination being built (e.g., in a string buffer), and an index representing which digit we are currently processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 The Recursive Backtracking Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive function, let's call it `backtrack(index, current_combination)`, works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:** If the `index` (the current digit we are processing) is equal to the length of the input `digits` string, it means a full combination has been formed. The `current_combination` is complete and is added to the final result list. The function then returns.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Step (Explore):** If it's not the base case, we look up the letters associated with the digit at `digits[index]`.\n",
    "    * The function iterates through each letter $L$ mapped to this digit.\n",
    "    * For each letter $L$, the algorithm makes a *choice*: append $L$ to the `current_combination`.\n",
    "    * It then makes a recursive call: `backtrack(index + 1, current_combination + L)`.\n",
    "3.  **Backtracking (Unwind):** After the recursive call returns, the algorithm implicitly \"undoes\" the choice of letter $L$ (by using a fixed-size array or by the way the string is passed/constructed), allowing the loop to proceed to the next letter for the current digit. This \"undo\" mechanism is what gives the algorithm its name, ensuring the state is clean for the next branch of the search tree. \n",

    "### ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity is directly proportional to the total number of combinations generated, as each combination takes constant time to build and add to the result. If $N$ is the length of the digits string, and $M$ is the maximum number of letters per digit (4 for '7' and '9', 3 for others), the complexity is **$O(M^N)$**. Specifically, it's closer to $O(4^N)$ or $O(3^N \\cdot 4^N)$, depending on the exact mapping. The total time is bounded by $O(\\text{Total Combinations} \\times \\text{Length of Combination})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The space complexity is $O(N)$ for the recursion depth, where $N$ is the number of digits, and $O(\\text{Total Combinations} \\times N)$ to store the final list of results. Given that the number of combinations grows exponentially, the complexity is dominated by the storage of the output."
