    "## 🔢 LeetCode Problem 7: Reverse Integer\n",
    "\n",
    "LeetCode problem 7, \"Reverse Integer,\" is a mathematical string manipulation problem that requires reversing the digits of a given 32-bit signed integer. While the core idea is simple, the primary challenge lies in handling the possibility of **integer overflow** during the reversal process.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❓ The Reversal Mechanism\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is to take an integer, $x$, and produce a new integer with its digits in the reverse order. For example, if $x = 123$, the output should be $321$; if $x = -123$, the output is $-321$; and if $x = 120$, the output is $21$. The standard technique for reversing digits involves a loop that repeatedly performs two operations: finding the last digit using the modulo operator ($x \\pmod{10}$) and removing the last digit using integer division ($\\lfloor x / 10 \\rfloor$).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ The Integer Overflow Constraint\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical complexity of this problem stems from the requirement that the output must fit within the range of a standard 32-bit signed integer, which is $[ -2^{31}, 2^{31} - 1 ]$. If the reversed number exceeds this range, the function must return 0. The overflow check cannot wait until the final result is calculated; it must be performed **before** the final digit is appended to the reversed number in each iteration of the loop, as the addition or multiplication step itself can cause the overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔎 Pre-emptive Overflow Check\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $rev$ be the reversed number so far, and $pop$ be the last digit popped from the original number $x$. In the next step, we want to update $rev$ to $rev_{new} = rev \\times 10 + pop$. To check for potential overflow, we compare $rev$ against the maximum and minimum limits of a 32-bit integer, denoted as $INT_{MAX} = 2^{31} - 1$ and $INT_{MIN} = -2^{31}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the positive case:\n",
    "1.  If $rev > INT_{MAX} / 10$, then multiplying $rev$ by 10 will surely overflow.\n",
    "2.  If $rev = INT_{MAX} / 10$, we check the last digit $pop$. If $pop > 7$ (since $INT_{MAX}$ ends in 7), the addition will cause an overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the negative case (using the absolute values for comparison):\n",
    "1.  If $rev < INT_{MIN} / 10$, then multiplying $rev$ by 10 will surely underflow.\n",
    "2.  If $rev = INT_{MIN} / 10$, we check the last digit $pop$. If $pop < -8$ (since $INT_{MIN}$ ends in 8), the addition will cause an underflow.  If any of these conditions are met, the loop must terminate and return 0 immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💻 The Final Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm proceeds by setting the `rev` variable to 0. It iterates while $x$ is not zero, extracting the $pop$ digit. Before updating $rev = rev \\times 10 + pop$, the pre-emptive overflow check is performed. If no overflow is detected, $rev$ is updated, and $x$ is truncated using integer division. Once $x$ becomes 0, the loop terminates, and the correctly reversed integer $rev$ is returned. This method correctly handles positive and negative numbers and ensures the result adheres to the 32-bit integer constraints."
