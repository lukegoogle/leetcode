    "The LeetCode problem 24, \"Swap Nodes in Pairs,\" asks us to modify a singly linked list by swapping every two adjacent nodes. For example, if the input list is $1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4$, the output should be $2 \\to 1 \\to 4 \\to 3$. The critical constraint is that the modification must be done by only altering the nodes' pointers; the actual values within the nodes cannot be changed. This is a common requirement in linked list problems to ensure a true structural modification. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Constraint: In-Place Modification**\n",
    "\n",
    "The requirement to swap the nodes *without changing their values* means we must perform **in-place manipulation** of the linked list pointers. If we were allowed to simply swap values, the solution would be trivial: traverse the list and swap the value of the current node with its next node. However, by restricting us to pointer manipulation, the problem becomes a classic exercise in safely redirecting the `next` pointers to achieve the desired reordering, which requires careful handling of three consecutive nodes at a time: the pair being swapped and the node *before* the pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Iterative Approach with a Dummy Head**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common and robust approach is to use an iterative method, typically facilitated by a **dummy head node**. A dummy head is a node created at the beginning of the list, pointing to the original head. This node simplifies edge cases, particularly when the original head of the list changes (which happens when the first pair is swapped). The iterative process uses a `current` pointer (or `prev`) that always points to the node *before* the pair being swapped.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Swapping Mechanism**\n",
    "\n",
    "The iteration proceeds by identifying a pair of nodes to swap: `first_node` (the `current->next`) and `second_node` (the `current->next->next`). The swap involves three critical pointer redirections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Connecting the Predecessor:** The node *before* the pair (`current`) must point to the new head of the pair, which is `second_node`.\n",
    "    $$\\text{current.next} = \\text{second\\_node}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Redirecting the Second Node:** The `second_node` must now point to the `first_node`.\n",
    "    $$\\text{first\\_node.next} = \\text{second\\_node.next}$$ (Store the original third node's location first.)\n",
    "    $$\\text{second\\_node.next} = \\text{first\\_node}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "After these three steps, the `first_node` and `second_node` are swapped, and the `current` node correctly links to the swapped pair. The `current` pointer is then advanced two steps (to `first_node`) to prepare for swapping the next pair. This continues until there are fewer than two nodes remaining.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Handling Edge Cases and Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop terminates when the `current` pointer cannot find a complete pair to swap. This occurs when either:\n",
    "* `current.next` is `null` (only one node remains or the end of the list is reached).\n",
    "* `current.next.next` is `null` (only one node remains in the potential pair).\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of the dummy head ensures that the function can correctly return the new head of the list, which is `dummy.next`, regardless of whether the original first two nodes were swapped or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative and often more elegant solution is the **Recursive Approach**. This method leverages the structure of the list by defining the solution for a pair in terms of the solution for the rest of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursive function takes the head of the current sublist as input.\n",
    "1.  **Base Case:** If the list is empty (`head` is `null`) or only has one node (`head.next` is `null`), no swap is possible, so we return the head.\n",
    "2.  **Recursive Step:** We define the first node of the pair as `first` and the second as `second`.\n",
    "    * The rest of the list, starting from the node *after* the pair (`second.next`), is handled by a recursive call:\n",
    "        $$\\text{first.next} = \\text{swapPairs}(\\text{second.next})$$\n",
    "    * The swap is completed by setting the `second.next` pointer to the `first` node:\n",
    "        $$\\text{second.next} = \\text{first}$$\n",
    "3.  **Return:** The function returns the new head of the sublist, which is `second`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive solution is extremely concise and performs the same $O(N)$ time complexity as the iterative approach but uses $O(N)$ space for the recursion stack depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Both the iterative and recursive approaches require visiting every node in the linked list exactly once. Therefore, the time complexity is linear, $O(N)$, where $N$ is the total number of nodes.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The iterative approach uses a constant amount of extra space for the pointers (`dummy`, `current`, `first`, `second`), resulting in $O(1)$ space complexity. The recursive approach uses $O(N)$ extra space due to the depth of the recursion stack, which can be up to $N/2$ calls.\n",
