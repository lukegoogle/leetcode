    "The LeetCode problem 26, \"Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array,\" is a fundamental challenge that tests a user's ability to manipulate arrays **in-place** with $O(1)$ extra space, leveraging the crucial property that the input array is already **sorted**. The goal is to remove the duplicates such that each unique element appears only once, and then return the new length of the modified array. The elements beyond the new length are irrelevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Core Constraint: In-Place Modification**\n",
    "\n",
    "The most critical constraint of this problem is the requirement for **in-place** modification with $O(1)$ extra memory. This means we cannot create a new array to store the results and then copy them back. Instead, we must use the existing array space to store the unique elements, shifting them to the beginning of the array. The final array elements are not truly \"removed\"; rather, the unique elements are overwritten into the initial slots, effectively compressing the unique data to the front.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Two-Pointer Approach (Fast and Slow)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal solution employs a classic technique known as the **Two-Pointer** method, which is highly effective for problems involving sorted arrays and in-place manipulation. We use a **Slow Pointer** (often called `i` or `unique_count`) and a **Fast Pointer** (often called `j` or `current_index`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Slow Pointer (`i`):** This pointer tracks the position where the *next unique element* should be placed. It represents the boundary between the processed unique part of the array and the unexplored part. It also implicitly tracks the count of unique elements found so far.\n",
    "2.  **Fast Pointer (`j`):** This pointer iterates through all elements of the array, checking for duplicates. It explores the array quickly. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Iteration and Comparison Logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with the slow pointer `i` at index 0 (or 1, depending on the implementation) and the fast pointer `j` starting at index 1. The fast pointer `j` iterates from the second element to the end of the array. In each iteration, we compare the element at the slow pointer's position (`nums[i]`) with the element at the fast pointer's position (`nums[j]`):\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Unique Element Found:** If `nums[i]` is **not equal** to `nums[j]`, it means `nums[j]` is a new, unique element. We must then:\n",
    "    * Increment the slow pointer `i` by one.\n",
    "    * Overwrite the content of the new slow pointer position with the unique element found by the fast pointer: `nums[i] = nums[j]`. This moves the unique element into its correct, compressed position.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Duplicate Element Found:** If `nums[i]` **is equal** to `nums[j]`, it means `nums[j]` is a duplicate. In this case, we do **nothing** with the slow pointer `i`. We simply let the fast pointer `j` advance to the next element. The duplicate element at `nums[j]` is ignored for now and will eventually be overwritten by a later unique element.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Initialization and Edge Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "The iteration can be set up simply:\n",
    "* Initialize the slow pointer `i = 0`. Since the first element `nums[0]` is always unique (as it's the start), the unique count starts at 1, and the slow pointer marks the end of the unique subarray.\n",
    "* The fast pointer `j` iterates from $1$ to the end of the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key edge case is an empty array. If the input array has a length of 0, the function should correctly return 0. The standard loop structure naturally handles this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Termination and Result**\n",
    "\n",
    "The process continues until the fast pointer `j` has traversed the entire array. Once the loop finishes, the elements from index 0 up to index `i` (inclusive) contain all the unique elements in their correct, sorted order. The length of this unique subarray is `i + 1`. The function must return this value as the new length. The values in the array beyond this length are irrelevant to the problem's solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The fast pointer `j` traverses the array exactly once, performing $N-1$ comparisons, where $N$ is the total number of elements. The overall time complexity is thus linear, $O(N)$. This is the most efficient possible time complexity since every element must be checked at least once.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The solution only uses a few integer variables for the pointers (`i` and `j`) and the loop control, without allocating any new arrays or data structures that scale with the input size $N$. Therefore, the space complexity is constant, $O(1)$, which satisfies the problem's strict constraint."
