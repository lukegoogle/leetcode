    "The LeetCode problem 41, \"First Missing Positive,\" is a highly challenging array manipulation problem that asks us to find the smallest positive integer (i.e., 1, 2, 3, ...) that is not present in an unsorted array of integers `nums`. The difficulty and the core constraint of the problem lie in the requirement to solve it in $O(n)$ time complexity and using only $O(1)$ extra space. This constraint immediately rules out sorting the array ($O(n \\log n)$) or using auxiliary hash sets ($O(n)$ space).\n",

    "### **The Core Insight: Using the Array as a Hash Map**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to achieving $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space is realizing that the numbers we are looking for are constrained to a small, predictable range: $1$ to $n$, where $n$ is the length of the array. If the array contained all numbers from 1 to $n$, the first missing positive would be $n+1$. If a number from 1 to $n$ is missing, that number must be the answer. Therefore, we only care about numbers within the range $[1, n]$. All numbers $\\le 0$ or $> n$ can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "The array itself can be repurposed as a **hash map** to mark the presence of numbers from 1 to $n$. The idea is to place the number $k$ into the index $k-1$. If we successfully place every number $k$ in the array into its \"home position\" at index $k-1$, then the first index $i$ where $nums[i] \\neq i+1$ reveals the first missing positive, $i+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 1: Placing Numbers into Their Correct Indices (Cyclic Sort)**\n",
    "\n",
    "We iterate through the array from index $i=0$ to $n-1$. At each index, we apply a logic often referred to as **Cyclic Sort** or bucket sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Check Conditions:** Consider the number $x = nums[i]$. We only care about $x$ if it satisfies $1 \\le x \\le n$.\n",
    "2.  **Determine Home Index:** The correct \"home\" index for $x$ is $x-1$.\n",
    "3.  **Perform Swap:** We need to swap $nums[i]$ with the number currently at its home position, $nums[x-1]$, to move $x$ to where it belongs.\n",
    "4.  **Avoid Redundant Swaps:** The swap is only performed if three conditions hold: $1 \\le x \\le n$, $x$ is not already at its home position ($nums[i] \\neq nums[x-1]$), and the element at $nums[i]$ is not the same as the element at $nums[x-1]$ (to handle duplicates). If a swap occurs, we do not increment $i$ because the new element at $nums[i]$ (the element that was at $nums[x-1]$) must also be checked and potentially placed in its own home. If no swap is needed, we increment $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this first phase, the array will be partially sorted, with all numbers in the range $[1, n]$ placed at their correct index $k-1$ (if they exist). All numbers outside this range or duplicates will occupy the remaining slots. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 2: Finding the First Mismatch**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Cyclic Sort (Phase 1) is complete, we iterate through the modified array one final time, from index $i=0$ to $n-1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Check Mismatch:** We check if the value at the current index $i$ is equal to what it should be: $nums[i] = i+1$.\n",
    "2.  **Found Missing Positive:** The moment we find the first index $i$ such that $nums[i] \\neq i+1$, the number $i+1$ is the first missing positive integer. We immediately return $i+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phase 3: The Edge Case (All Numbers Present)**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the loop in Phase 2 completes without finding any mismatch, it means that the array contains all the integers from $1$ to $n$ in their correct positions. In this case, the first missing positive integer is $n+1$. We return $n+1$. This handles cases like $nums=[1, 2, 3]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Although the inner swap logic (Cyclic Sort) seems complex, the key is that every element is swapped into its correct place at most once. For a valid placement, the element $x$ is moved to $x-1$. After that, it is never moved again. The total number of swaps and checks is bounded by $O(n)$. Therefore, the entire process—including the initial sort and the final scan—is performed in linear time, $O(n)$.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The algorithm only uses a few constant variables for iteration and swapping. Since the manipulation is entirely performed on the input array, the auxiliary space complexity is $O(1)$, satisfying the strict space constraint."
