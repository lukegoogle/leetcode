    "The LeetCode problem 46, \"Permutations,\" is a fundamental combinatorial problem that asks us to find all possible **unique permutations** of a given collection of distinct integers. Given an array of $N$ distinct numbers, the goal is to generate all $N!$ (N-factorial) possible ordered arrangements of these numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Approach: Backtracking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the goal is to find *all* possible valid arrangements, and the process involves making a sequence of choices (selecting which number goes into which position), the problem is perfectly suited for a **Backtracking** algorithm, implemented via Depth-First Search (DFS). Backtracking allows us to explore the entire decision space systematically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Structure and State**\n",
    "\n",
    "The backtracking function, say `generatePermutations(current_permutation, available_numbers)`, builds a permutation one element at a time. The state of the recursion is defined by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`current_permutation`**: The list or array holding the sequence of numbers chosen so far in the current path.\n",
    "2.  **`available_numbers`**: A mechanism to track which numbers from the input set have not yet been used in the `current_permutation`. This is crucial for ensuring that each number is used exactly once per permutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Base Case and Termination**\n",
    "\n",
    "The recursion terminates when a complete and valid permutation is formed. This occurs when the length of the `current_permutation` is equal to the length of the original input array $N$. At this point, the completed permutation is added to the final result list, and the function returns to explore other branches of the search tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Recursive Step (Choosing and Backtracking)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The main loop iterates over the set of numbers that are currently **available** (i.e., not yet included in the `current_permutation`).\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Choose:** An available number $C$ is selected.\n",
    "    * $C$ is added to the `current_permutation`.\n",
    "    * $C$ is marked as \"used\" (removed from the available set).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Recurse:** The function makes a recursive call to `generatePermutations` to continue building the rest of the permutation. The state of the permutation is passed to the next level of the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Unchoose (Backtrack):** After the recursive call returns (meaning all permutations starting with the current choices have been explored), the state must be reset so that the loop can try the next available number. This involves **backtracking**:\n",
    "    * $C$ is removed from the end of the `current_permutation`.\n",
    "    * $C$ is marked as \"unused\" (returned to the available set).\n",
    "\n",
    "This systematic choose/recurse/unchoose process ensures that every possible ordering of the numbers is eventually generated. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation Details: Tracking Available Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two primary ways to track the `available_numbers` to ensure the \"distinct numbers\" constraint:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Using a Visited Array/Boolean Array:** A boolean array of the same size as the input array is initialized to `False`. When a number $nums[i]$ is used, `visited[i]` is set to `True`. The loop iterates over all original indices $i$, and only proceeds if `visited[i]` is `False`. This is common when the input array contains distinct values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Using Sets or Lists (Direct Manipulation):** Alternatively, the recursive function can pass the list of remaining available numbers to the next level. When a number is chosen, it is removed from the list passed to the next recursive call. This simplifies the logic but often requires copying lists, which adds $O(N)$ overhead to each recursive step, potentially increasing the time complexity constant factor. The visited array approach is generally preferred for its $O(1)$ lookup time per number.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** The total number of permutations of $N$ items is $N!$. Since we generate every single permutation, the time complexity is at least $O(N!)$. For each permutation, we perform $N$ steps of selection, and in each step, we iterate through $O(N)$ available numbers. Thus, the total time complexity is $O(N \\cdot N!)$.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The space is determined by the storage needed for the final result (storing $N!$ permutations of length $N$, which is $O(N \\cdot N!)$) and the depth of the recursion stack, which is $O(N)$. The auxiliary space for the `visited` array or temporary storage is $O(N)$."
