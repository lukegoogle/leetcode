    "The LeetCode problem 48, \"Rotate Image,\" requires rotating a given $N \\times N$ 2D matrix (representing an image) by 90 degrees clockwise. The most stringent constraint of this problem is that the rotation must be done **in-place**, meaning the transformation must be achieved by modifying the input matrix directly without allocating another full $N \\times N$ matrix for temporary storage, thereby achieving $O(1)$ extra space complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Fundamental Challenge: In-Place Manipulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotating an image by 90 degrees clockwise means that the element at the top-left corner moves to the top-right corner, the top-right moves to the bottom-right, the bottom-right moves to the bottom-left, and the bottom-left moves back to the top-left. For any element at position $(row, col)$, its new position $(row', col')$ after a 90-degree clockwise rotation is:\n",
    "$$(row, col) \\to (col, N - 1 - row)$$\n",
    "The challenge is that moving one element overwrites the data needed for the next step. To achieve the rotation in-place, the process must handle the four elements involved in a single cycle simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach 1: Rotating in Cycles (Four-Corner Swap)**\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach directly implements the cyclic nature of the rotation. The matrix can be decomposed into concentric square layers, and each layer can be rotated independently. For each layer, the rotation involves swapping elements in groups of four.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Layers and Boundaries:** The rotation is performed layer by layer, from the outermost layer inward. We define the current layer's boundaries by indices: `start_row`, `end_row`, `start_col`, and `end_col`. For an $N \\times N$ matrix, there are $\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor$ layers.\n",
    "2.  **Iterating the Layer:** Within a layer, we iterate along the top edge from `start_col` to `end_col - 1`. For each element $(r, c)$ on the top edge, it is the starting point of a 4-element cycle.\n",
    "3.  **The Four-Way Swap:** For a starting position $(r, c)$, we perform the following simultaneous swap using a temporary variable:\n",
    "    * **Save Top:** Save the value of $matrix[r][c]$ in a temp variable.\n",
    "    * **Top $\\leftarrow$ Left:** $matrix[r][c] \\leftarrow matrix[N-1-c][r]$\n",
    "    * **Left $\\leftarrow$ Bottom:** $matrix[N-1-c][r] \\leftarrow matrix[N-1-r][N-1-c]$\n",
    "    * **Bottom $\\leftarrow$ Right:** $matrix[N-1-r][N-1-c] \\leftarrow matrix[c][N-1-r]$\n",
    "    * **Right $\\leftarrow$ Saved Top:** $matrix[c][N-1-r] \\leftarrow \\text{temp}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This cyclic swap completes the rotation for four elements in $O(1)$ space. We repeat this for all elements on the layer's top edge, then move to the next inner layer until the center is reached. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach 2: Transpose and Reflect (Two-Step Method)**\n",
    "\n",
    "A more elegant and often easier-to-implement $O(1)$ space solution is to decompose the 90-degree clockwise rotation into two simpler, known matrix transformations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Step 1: Transpose the Matrix:** The transpose operation swaps elements across the main diagonal. For every pair of indices $(i, j)$ where $i < j$, we swap $matrix[i][j]$ with $matrix[j][i]$. The rows become columns and vice versa.\n",
    "2.  **Step 2: Reverse Each Row (Reflection):** After transposing, we perform a horizontal reflection (or flip) across the central vertical axis. This is achieved by reversing the elements in every single row of the matrix. For each row $i$, we swap $matrix[i][j]$ with $matrix[i][N-1-j]$ for $j$ from $0$ up to $\\lfloor N/2 \\rfloor - 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of the transpose followed by the row reversal is mathematically equivalent to a 90-degree clockwise rotation. This approach is highly favored for its clear logic. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Complexity Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both the Cyclic Swap and the Transpose-and-Reflect methods achieve the optimal time and space complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Time Complexity:** Both approaches require iterating through approximately half of the matrix elements (for the cycles or the transpose) and then iterating through the rows (for the reflection). Since we touch every element at most a constant number of times, the time complexity is $O(N^2)$, where $N$ is the side length of the matrix.\n",
    "* **Space Complexity:** The requirement for $O(1)$ extra space is met by both methods, as they only use a few temporary variables for swapping, regardless of the matrix size. The solution is thus optimized for memory usage."
